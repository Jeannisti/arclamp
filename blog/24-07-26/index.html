'm listening to a novel right now that is weirdly resonant with me. It's exactly the sort of book that I would have liked to have written; historical, but religiously supernatural-infused fiction with strong horror undertones, somewhat literary ambitions, and a refreshing lack of clich√©. It's not exactly Earth-shattering literature, but it's off-putting and strange and charming, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. It doesn't have the real historical rootedness of a Kristin Lavransdatter, but the man can set a scene, and handles Catholicism as the backdrop for his horror story better than I have any right to expect from a modern writer.

I once started a novel set in medieval Spain, in which a demented traveler writer follows a genuine witch around the landscape to record her adventures. I still think fondly on the idea, and the weirdness of tone that I was trying to cultivate, and Between Two Fires is a less comical and better written version of what I was trying to do. It's neat to come across someone with similar sensibilities.
