<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 ended up working a lot today -- I finished a three-day job, ate lunch, and then charged off to finish a day-and-a-half job. I'm pretty tired now, but turning around two jobs in a day feels very good; I made a lot of money today, and we definitely need it.
</p>
<p>
I'm still loving my job. I've held a few jobs in my time, and this one is by far the most satisfying. The directness of the exchange I have with my clients is extremely refreshing -- I'm there at every stage of the project, and everyone walks away happy. It feels very human and social, very unlike the heavily-mediated interactions I'm used to having in a professional setting.
