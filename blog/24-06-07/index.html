wo of my very best friends are on the cusp of becoming schismatics, which is way better than being Protestants, and <i>way</i> better than being atheists. I'm sure some traditionalist Catholics would try to get me to be pissy and moany about them not hitting the nail on the head and joining the Barque of Peter, but I cannot help but be overjoyed for them.

Apart from "fidelity to the Pope", I'm not sure the vast majority of Catholics or Orthodox could even enunciate the theological differences between the two. A particular take resonates with me, that it sure looks like the Orthodox need the kind of unity that a visible head of the Church can give, and it sure looks like the Pope needs a bunch of orthodox Patriarchs to confer with as brothers; in other words, the Schism was an unnatural rending of the fabric of the Church, and both sides are worse off for it. Unlike the scattered Protestant tribes, it is so clear that Catholics and Orthodox are <i>two parts of the same church</i>, sadly estranged. I almost feel like the laity ought to just start treating them as the same Church, in which we are all brothers and sisters, and see where that gets us; I'm sure the theological differences matter, but I'm also sure that the only way they're going to get worked out is with a little bit of fraternizing and friction. I want to be close to the Orthodox, and it looks like I might get to be very close to them indeed, very soon.

I can't wait to hear about Eli and Abby's first Confessions, and first Communions. It's all fun and games until the Sacraments get rolling.
