he house is starting to come together. Today, Elena and I put together a list of projects we're planning. It was intimidatingly long, until we started breaking it down into difficulty and importance, and then it began to look more manageable. It's an extremely pleasant feeling, having a partner to tackle the daily art of living. We have someone to help us out, and also someone to keep us motivated -- I want to do my part to make my wife's life better, and she wants to do the same for me. We cleaned and tidied, and I prepped a few tasks for later. It's mud season outside, and we've decided to hole up for a few days, waiting for the road to dry out a bit (things are not looking promising). I really could just spend every day like this. It's too bad Adam and Eve really screwed the pooch on this one, and now we have to work by the sweat of our brow. Just steadily improving life around the home is such a killer way to spend time.
