<p>
he first step to getting out of debt is to stop getting in more debt. This applies to all kinds of debts, from money, to projects, to time.
</p>
<p>
Take this blog. More than a month ago, I fell seriously behind -- there were probably ten days unaccounted for in my daily blogging practice. The idea of trying to sit down and write ten blog posts to catch back up is a very intimidating one.
</p>
<p>
But I didn't have to do that. All I had to do was <i>stop getting more in blog-debt</i>. I wrote a post every day; and some days, I got done a little early, and still had a little juice, or I happened to have a couple good ideas. So I wrote two posts on those days.
</p>
<p>
And now, finally, I'm back on top. I have, as of today, written one blog post per day, for the year of 2,024 to date. Now; let's not let it happen again.
