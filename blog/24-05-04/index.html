pparently, nearly a quarter of my high school graduating class now lives within twenty minutes of B----, V-----. Jim and his wife Holly pulled us together, spur of the moment, at their home in the green hills. There were two baby girls, two dogs, several carpenters, and a lot of crocs in attendance. The magnetism of this state, and a particular way of life within it, continues to make itself known. My generation, and this time and place, seem to have generated a lot of love for simplicity, the countryside, marriage and children, honest work; it's pretty unusual within wider society, but somehow a startling percentage of the people who I met between the ages of 13 and 18 have converged on the outlines of a style of life no longer often seen. It's heartwarming, while also being startling. It makes me think about how our tastes are made, and about the character that different generations may take on. The wibe feels distinct, personal -- it's hard to imagine these people in another time or place. I like 'em.
