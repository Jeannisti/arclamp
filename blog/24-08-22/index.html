ccounting is a pretty interesting subject. When I first started my business, I was doing basically no accounting -- I just guessed how much time and materials a job would take me, invented some high-sounding pay rate, multiplied them together and charged that. All my payments, and all my costs, just went into the same bank account, and I just hoped that the amount in there would be the same or higher at the start of a new month as at the start of the one before it. I didn't really understand my own pricing, and it was very hard to tell if I was making money or not.

Turns out, what you really have to do is <i>depersonalize</i> all your numbers. Set up basic system that would keep track of things <i>as if</i> you had employees doing them -- then, if <i>you</i> do those things, <i>pay yourself like an employee</i>. For example, the business owner gets 8% of revenue, the job supervisor gets 4%, and the sales department gets 3%. I do all of those things currently, so I pay myself 15% of revenue. 10% is profit, which is <i>not</i> take-home pay, but money to be re-invested in the company. And, labor costs are factored into the job costs; if I'm the one on site, I get paid hourly, exactly as if I were an employee.
</p>
<p>
Seeing this all laid out really clarified things for me. I have a <i>much</i> better sense of how to determine my pricing, and very clear reasoning to be able to defend it. I know exactly how much money I'm making, and I know how well my business is doing from month to month. And the best part is, this template is fuly convertible to things like using subcontractors or eventually employees; the structure is already there.
