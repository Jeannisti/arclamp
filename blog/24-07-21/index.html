<p>
 get extremely emotional when I give somebody something that they truly appreciate, or show them something that really resonates. That feeling of hitting the nail on the head, of connecting with someone over a shared insight, makes me very teary, and it's hard to fight back. Today, I led my Schola in our Gregorian chant, and we were working with a skeleton crew of three, instead of our usual six. Recently, it came to my attention that basically no one except the choirmaster and myself knew anything about chant rhythm theory, or how to follow the conductor during our performances, so I put on an impromptu lesson for my Schola-mates on how to understand the "pulses" of the chant, and how to follow my lead. I then proceeded to get a bit misty-eyed when Pete, another singer, told me that the chant was all of a sudden making <i>way</i> more sense to him; and our little crew went on to have a very nicely synced performance. It was just a little thing, but I love when I'm able to give just a bit more understanding to someone about a thing that I love.
