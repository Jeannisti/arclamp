<p>
usiness meeting tonight with the boys. I developed such an intense dislike of the notion of "business" when I was young, and then I was thrust into a position of contributing to business decisions on a previous project I was on, and found out that I <i>really liked it</i>. Will got his first taste of that feeling tonight, the sensation of planning together for the future, and remaking the world, even just a little bit. This time, it's geared around Blackletter, and powered by Kelvin's type-A personality. I hope it goes somewhere, but even if it doesn't, I'm excited by what we'll learn along the way.
