re spiritual dangers different from physical dangers in god's will? That is to say, could demons attack a completely blameless person? Or at least, someone who had done nothing to draw demonic activity to them? We seem to be resistant to this idea. It doesn't seem fair -- surely God and the angels protect us from demons, unless we somehow foolishly draw their attention.

However, terrible <i>physical</i> things happen to good people all the time. This is the classic "Problem of Evil" for God's existence. Personally, I don't find the problem particularly acute -- I think a just God is perfectly compatible with suffering, especially considering how myopic our perspective on Creation is. But, why might someone accept that earthquakes or plagues might befall a good person, but not demonic possession? Is it because of a presumed metaphysic that demons can find no purchase on a soul protected by the armor of Christ, in whom no great sin has made a chink? Is it the assumption that God's will is more powerfully made manifest in the spiritual realm? Or is it that moral and spiritual terrors are so much more frightening and damning that we need to believe God would protect us from them unless we invited them in?
