oday was my beloved's birthday, and things clicked along merrily. I worked for a few hours in the morning, starting and completing a project for a new client, bought flowers and chocolate, spent time with my son and wife, and then my mother came over to help watch John while Elena and I went out for dinner. It was sunny and beautiful out, there were cats in the window at the cafe, and I found out that the pool hall in town also has a bunch of chess boards. Elena and I drank sake and laughed until we cried.

It wasn't all perfect -- John was pretty fussy while I was out in the morning, and is causing his mother no end of worry by being a bit constipated. But I was glad to be around for this birthday, with this incredible woman.
