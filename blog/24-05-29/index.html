uppose A has a beloved dog, which he lends to B to care for. B is also quite fond of the dog. B and C get into an argument, and in a fit of spite, C kills the dog in order to get back at B. From whom does C most need to beg forgiveness for his terrible act?
</p>
<p>
I think it's clear that C needs <i>primarily</i> to beg A's forgiveness; even though his act was intended to hurt B, he actually wounded A far more.
</p>
<p>
This is the hidden principle and riddle surrounding Jesus's claim to forgive sins. C. S. Lewis first brought this point to my attention, by noticing that Jesus appears to be treating <i>himself</i> as the primary wronged party -- for it is in the nature of forgiveness that only the person who was actually wronged (or their agent) can offer forgiveness for the act. It makes no sense for some man, even a very moral man, to go around forgiving the sins of various people he met, which is precisely why the Pharisees accuse him of blasphemy. They understand that only God can forgive sins, precisely because God is the one most wronged when humans sin.
</p>
<p>
This point I think is somewhat obscure to modern people. We have trouble understanding in what way God is being wronged when we, say, harm our neighbor (or ourselves, or, for people's understanding of certain sins, "no one"). This is why I opened with the parable that I did. The fact is that <i>all</i> we have and are comes from God -- we are merely the temporary stewards of His work. To sin is precisely to damage our relationship with the creator. It is very good to ask your neighbor's forgiveness -- but it is absolutely necessary to ask your Lord's.
