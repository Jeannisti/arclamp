<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 drove an hour and a half to my new job site, only to find that the road was closed for construction. I drove back to McDonald's to get internet to check on the road, and to go to the bathroom, but the building was under construction -- no internet, no bathrooms. In the drive through, a guy in a tall truck scooted his bumper onto my trailer and tore off his own license plate. I went to my mom's to see what work I could do there, and found out that the walls of her tub-space were <i>still</i> too close together, even after the slot I cut, and I was only <i>barely</i> able to scrape and puff and force the tub in there.
</p>
<p>
It was, as the McDonald's employee who handed me my sausage McMuffin so succinctly put it, one of those days.
</p>
<p>
But this one, I managed to get under control. I could feel the stress rising, but on a short errand drive, managed to calm myself down, see my problems clearly, and end my work day ahead of schedule. I went home to my beautiful wife, went grocery shopping and made her laugh, and got to enjoy my quiet home. Those days don't always getcha.
