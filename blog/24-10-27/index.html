<p>
 little vacation can wear you out more than months of work, especially if it not's particularly well-planned-for. My in-laws have been in town for the last week, which has been incredibly delightful. But a new business doesn't particularly care for vacation time, and I've been swamped by several jobs coming in at the same time, while trying to negotiate two different subcontractors starting two different jobs simultaneously. It's been a lot to have on the mind, and I really want to get everything straightened out. If I can make it through the next couple weeks, I could start to get a good system going, but it's going to be a lot of work in the meantime. But, at least I'll have my nose down, doing something about it -- the worst work is the work you need to do, but <i>can't</i>.
