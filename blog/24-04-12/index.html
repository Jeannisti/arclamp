low progress. The big project, renovating my mom's bathroom, is just about done -- all that's left is finishing off the drywall mudding, and then painting. It feels very good, and I'm very happy with how the whole thing went. Then, I came home and lifted a bunch of heavy things. I have a bunch of different exercises, each of which has their own weight-settings, and are increasing at different rates, so some still feel easy, while others are an enormous strain. Eventually, they'll all even out, and the whole freaking hour will just suck, I guess. But that's the only way to get stronk.

Then I reorganized my entirely-too-small tool-room, which is <i>better</i>, though still woefully inadequate. But it's all baby steps. Hopefully, each day we're preparing the make the next days a little better, if we play our cards right. Then we just wait for the Lord to drop the hammer on us, and call us to wherever we're needed. I'm going to have a son or a daughter soon -- reporting for duty, sir.
