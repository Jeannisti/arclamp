<p>
he Old Lands, known as Faerie, where the Other Folk lived and where heroes traveled, has broken away from the Contemporia in disgust. Where the fabric of the worlds was torn is now called the Ignorance, by those unlucky few who know of it. These men and women would once have been counted among the wise and learned, who journeyed across the veil and lived. But now they are tainted, and carry on them the Stink, which the ordinary people of the world cannot abide. So these cursed hobble along, homeless and unwelcome in the modern city streets, venturing into the Ignorance for what strange spoils it will cough up; and tolerating the horrible monstrosities that live therein, terrible fusions of faerie beings and human technological might, flotsam and jetsam from both worlds tossed into the violent roil of their great divorce.
