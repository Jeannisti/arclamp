s far as manual labor goes, interior painting is actually pretty fun. It's so easy to get into a flow state, and the hours roll by remarkably quickly. Roll out the plastic, cut, cut, cut, roll, repeat. Keeping things tidy while painting is so important, and I think I'm starting to internalize the kind of care and cleanliness that will level up all sorts of work. Open one thing at a time; make sure the surfaces are protected; take your time; walk slowly. At the end of the day, I feel fast, even though every step felt slow. This, I suspect, is the tao.
