<p>
or me, the wildest part of the eclipse is <i>right</i> when you're able to look at the sun for the first time, and you can suddenly see the enormous blackness of the moon, perfectly formed, that had been hidden a moment earlier by the brilliance of its elder brother. It's wild just how long much of the sun can be covered, and still be bright enough to blind the uncovered eye. It's only at the last moment, right before Totality, that it's dim enough to be viewed, and the moon might as well have been created ex nihilo in that very second. All of a sudden, there is something enormous, black, and oppressive crowding out all that is good and holy in the sky. Things get dark very quickly after that.
