<p>
at Metheny was a defining sound of my childhood; his albums <i>Still Life (Talking)</i> and <i>Letter from Home</i> are enormous monuments of melody in my recollection, bearing tremendous emotional power. Tonight, I crossed off my bucket list seeing him in concert. My brother and I substantially below the average age of the audience members, considering that this musician was at the height of his popularity in the late eighties. But the show was wonderful; predominantly acoustic, completely solo, varying widely in style. Two and half hours passed <i>very</i> quickly. The man is an incomparable genius, and it's a tremendous blessing that I got to see him while he is still in such command of his powers.
