hat is a species? When we try to define it, we generally start with a “mating group” -- the largest group such that any two individuals of the appropriate sex can reproduce. This turns out to be an insufficient definition for a number of reasons, such as ring species, geographic isolation, genetic "gradients", and so on. But most interesting to me is that species clearly have a “form” or essence to them which requires explanation.
</p>
<p>
What I mean is this: health and sickness are objective aspects of individual animals, which is a completely invisible concept within the "mating group" definition. Animal species clearly have a sort of “ideal”, roughly speaking, which certain animals can deviate from. Clearly, there are grey areas, such as lightly divergent phenotypes, helpful mutations, deviations that offer trade-offs of various kinds, etc. But even more obviously there are clear cases in which a mark of some kind has been missed. Birth defects, genetic diseases, physical mutilation -- these words take their meaning from the concept of a "healthy" animal. A sick animal is one that is lacking powers or qualities that it was <i>intended</i> to have. Everything else about it seems to "assume" the wholeness that it lacks.
</p>
<p>
Giving this quality of species a rigorous definition is extraordinarily difficult. Life is far more sophisticated than we often give it credit for.
