he snow is piled high outside. I've shoveled three times today, and I'll have to do it again tomorrow morning. I had the foresight to grab a bunch of logs off the stack last night, and Elena and I had a piping hot fire all day to tide us through the delicious little snow day we ended up having. We bummed around and did a whole bunch of nothing. Elena's working on her first sci fi soldier miniatures, and she's taking to it beautifully -- the leader of her unit turned out to be a gnarled old man, bent over a cane, but still holding aloft his sword. It was all games and soup and radiant heat today. Elena brought up that all too soon, we'd never be alone ever again (or at least, not for a couple decades). This was a nice day of being alone together.

But seriously, there's so much freaking snow outside. It's supposed to be Spring, and we're just getting pounded with long range precipitation artillery. Pretty wild.
