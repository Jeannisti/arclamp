he Year of the Word. A year for meditating upon, soaking in, accumulating, and developing Words. This year, I will turn from my endless article-browsing, and turn toward book-hillocks that dot my home. I'll study the Lord's Word. I'll send emails and letters. I'll keep this blog daily.

Once upon a time, I wanted to be a writer. I think I still do, though I don't care for the idea of making it my work. Any educated person should be able to write coherently. They should be able to make their friends laugh and cry at least, and make an argument seem interesting. Writing is one of the small crafts that can improve any life, and I've let it languish too long.

I've been thinking a great deal about <i>play</i> of late. I'd like to be able to play in words. Cast a little dust up and see what settles. Maybe I'll write a few pages of my Superman idea.

Every thinking person should read <a href="https://zazenbozo.com/">Zazenbozo</a>, but also no one who doesn't know him should read it. An inspiration to any writer-with-a-lowercase-w. Write to those you love, and do it well just for the hell of it.
