<p>
e make our visage so frightful because of who our enemies are. The snouts of jackals and horns of oxen, the sneers of bats and tongues of snakes; we endeavor to make these tools a fraction as awful as those wielded by our foes. Against us they march, foreheads smeared with acidic waters; terrible instruments of torture hang about their necks in mockery; and the blood of their own Master drips from their lips, His flesh caught between their teeth. Truly, great invention is required of us to overmatch these terrors, and rarely, I think, do we succeed. Still; their own ignorance will be their downfall, and the truth is still that the numbers of their true soldiers are few; and we are Legion."
