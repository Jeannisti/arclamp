<p>
here are so many traditional things that kind of fell off my radar when I became a Single Adult that are just delightfully returning to life now that I'm a Married Father, especially one whose wife is a stranger in a strange land (a book, by the way, that I haven't read, but that has one of the great titles of all time). Last week we went apple picking in an orchard, and now we've carved pumpkins and roasted pumpkin seeds. The air outside is a perfect dry chill, and our little candlefaces grin mischievously down our country lane.
</p>
<p>
Having these things to share and pass on adds another dimension to life. Years of absence from these little traditions ossify you. You forget to take delight in such works, forget to go out of your way to keep them alive. It will be easier now, for many years, and I look forward to them eagerly.
