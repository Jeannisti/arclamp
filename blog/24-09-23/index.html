<p>
esterday at Mass, I asked my friend Michael if he wanted to try covering my normal place in the Schola as Second Cantor. The Second Cantor is in charge of half the Schola, and joins the Lead Cantor during the most complicated chants: the Gradual and the Alleluia versicles. We're trying to offer more experience and responsibility to more members of the Schola, and this was a first step in that direction.
</p>
<p>
It was <i>hard</i> giving up that position. Hard in a way that indicates interior work that needs doing within me. Being Second Cantor is a great honor, and getting to duet with the Lead Cantor is <i>the</i> most fun part of the Mass. I am proud (too proud) of my ability to sight read and sing competently the graduals, and I love receving compliments after Mass for my voice. Yesterday, the compliments were Michael's to receive, and he deserved them. He did a great job, and I'm very proud of him for taking on a not inconsiderable task.
</p>
<p>
It was a minor sacrifice to offer up that role, but it stung. I should be seeking out more like opportunities, to glory not in myself, but in the Lord.
