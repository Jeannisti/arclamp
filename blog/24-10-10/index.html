<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 used to be utterly baffled by workaholics. I understood the desire to work, in some sense; but for me, that work was always directed at hobbies, or personal growth, or something along these lines. The idea that one could "get carried away" by economic work, and even be said to <i>enjoy</i> being busy in this way completely foreign to me.
</p>
<p>
I'm starting to see now how it works. Mark Forster says that one of the biggest motivations we can have in our work is not "enjoyableness", or even "meaningfulness" -- but rather, <i>being on top of our work</i> (whatever it is). Simply feeling like you can handle the work you have to do gives you the energy and motivation to keep at it, and take satisfaction from it.
</p>
<p>
My days are busy lately. Not full-to-the-brim, not-a-moment-to-breathe busy, but still substantially so. But it doesn't feel like it's wearing me out, the way a workweek used to grind on me. Rather, I feel energized, and looking forward to the next challenges. It's such an enormous difference, too, that all my work is self-directed now -- it doesn't feel like my energy is being sucked out of me to further someone else's goals.
</p>
<p>
But time passes quickly in this state. I think I need to put effort in to stave off the classic failing of the workaholic -- letting your life slip away, and waking up to find your kids grown, and all your memories of spreadsheets and clients.
