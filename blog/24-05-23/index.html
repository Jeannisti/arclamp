<p>
 get something akin to vertigo when I think of some of those "near misses" of my life. The most obvious is the story of meeting my wife, Elena -- there was nothing necessary about the circumstance, and it could so very, very easily have never happened. We were separated by thousands of miles, and both chanced to be on Catholic Match at the same time, which both of us were on the verge of permanently quitting. I'd been through several sprees of dating, and with a couple of the women I met, considered trying to make things more serious. There are so, so many possible worlds in which Elena and I just never met, and I do not want to live in <i>any</i> of them.

This incredible woman is just the center of my life, and I can't believe that I'm able to fall more in love with her literally every day. I've been dreaming about being a husband and a father for such a long time now, and to be actually living it with Elena and little John is a bit more than I can believe. To think that it all stood on the edge of a knife in my past, and I had no idea... it makes me dizzy. Thank the Lord that it has turned out the way it has so far. Even if the other shoe eventually drops, this will all have been the blessing of a lifetime.
