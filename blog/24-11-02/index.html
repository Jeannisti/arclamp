here's nothing like brainstorming with Will and Eli. There's something about the three of us together that just gets the wheels turning when developing story ideas -- we know how to take good ideas and run with them, let others sit on the backburner for a bit, make one another laugh, and get at the core of the experience we're shooting for. It's pretty magical when it goes well, and we actually have a pretty good record of inventing some genuinely good stuff.
</p>
<p>
At any rate: we're planning a new Burning Wheel campaign, and we've got a pretty fun situation lined up for Will's and Eli's characters. Will is a criminal with an infant son, who has discovered that he looks remarkably similar to Eli, the young nobleman preparing to enter monastic life. Will has stolen Eli's identity, planning to take over his inheritance, while Eli disappears into a monastery, none the wiser. Meanwhile, Eli has made a deal with a devil, promising him his first child, but knowing that as a monk, he will never marry. It turns out that the devil has been tricked by Will's identity-thievery, and now wants <i>his</i> firstborn. At the same time, the constable in pursuit of career-criminal Will now believes that Eli is his culprit, and the two now have to flee together with Will's child to untangle the whole mess.

I've never intentionally run a farce in an RPG before, and am very much looking forward to the opportunity to do so.
