ow should Christians understand pacifism, violence, and war? What does the New Testament tell us about such things as soldiery, self-defense, crime and punishment, government, and so on?
</p>
<p>
Consider: Jesus tell us that blessed are the peacemakers.
</p>
<p>
Consider: Jesus tells us to resist not evil -- to turn the other cheek, to give our cloak also if our tunic is taken, to walk an extra mile when we are compelled.
</p>
<p>
Consider: In the parable of the Great Banquet, the king who throws the banquet and sends out invitation is angered when his servants are killed and treated shamelessly by those he invited. He therefore sends out his armies to destroy them, and burn their cities. Now, it might be said this is just a parable -- but parables take their force from the "rightness" of the story, which is then transferred by analogy to the spiritual insight. In this case, the king represents God, and the wicked guests those who reject his call. If the king in the story's actions are unjust, the parable loses all weight, and we have learned nothing spiritually. Jesus seems to be saying that the king acted justly by destroying the wicked guests. Other parables likewise lean on some forms of violence for their narrative to make sense.
</p>
<p>
Consider: when Jesus meets the Centurion at Capernaum, he does not call this professional soldier to repentance for his military deeds, but praises him for faith, the likes of which have not been seen in all Israel. Jesus frequently calls people of other professions, such as thieves, prostitutes, tax collectors, and scribes, to repentance for their sins, but he does not do so with the Roman Centurion. Nor does Peter require of Cornelius that he resign his position as a soldier after his baptism; instead, his advice is "Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages."
</p>
<p>
Consider: Jesus tells Peter to put down his sword, when he attempts to defend the most innocent of all men from unjust punishment.
</p>
<p>
Consider: Jesus tells us that he comes not to bring peace, but a sword.
</p>
<p>
I do not think these accounts are contradictory. I think there is much to meditate on about them, but I do not confess to immediately understand the overarching Christian view on violence. I think it is overwhelmingly clear that violence is unacceptable for personal or national gain. I think it is likewise clear that on a personal level, a Christian should always be looking for peace, and seeking to let God's will be done, rather than their own, trusting in him, rather than resisting the forces of the world. However, it seems to me that there is a strain in the New Testament of certain authoritative contexts in which impartial justice interacts with violence in a way that does not offend the Lord. I will have to think more on this.
