here are a couple of writers that I rather enjoy who are in some sense "radicals". They reject modernity, or at least great swathes of it, and then actually follow through on that rejection -- doing things like owning no car, living truly self-sustainably off the land, eschewing the "rat race".
</p>
<p>
Part of me wants to be a radical, or pursue radicalism in some way. There's something very grand about it, something very <i>coherent</i> about making sacrifices for one's beliefs. I suppose the question becomes, what do you want, and how badly do you want it?
</p>
<p>
These radicals tell me that their way of life bears fruit that is difficult to communicate to someone who hasn't followed them. I'm used to this kind of perspective -- it's precisely the way I feel about the Christian faith.
</p>
<p>
So what do I, and my family, want? I want to be grounded in the earth, and know the real cost of a mile (say, by walking or biking everywhere). But I also want to see my family regularly, who live an hour or more from me <i>by car</i>. I cannot both not have a car, and travel regularly to see my family -- so what to do? Just how much is the simplicity, connection, strength, and lack of bureaucracy of car-avoidance actually worth? Is it worth making my family come to see us, if we're to see them at all? How does one even gauge this choice?
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it's a rare sacrifice that doesn't force someone <i>else</i> to sacrifice a bit at the same time.
