etting baby advice sucks, not because it's hard to find, but because it's too easy. We've received communiqu√©s on how to do various things for our child from our midwife, the hospital staff, our follow-up medical personnel, the two lactation consultants we saw, our pediatrician, and any old member of our friends or family groups who care to chime in. Not surprisingly, the advice conflicts sometimes, and when you have a difficult-to-resolve problem with your infant son, this can be exceedinly frustrating.

<p>
This is an important consideration in a lot of areas of life, but controlling your information streams is vital if you want to survive. You'll end up in superstition and bone-casting soon enough if you don't get a lid on all the different ways people are trying to convince you that <i>their</i> take is important.
