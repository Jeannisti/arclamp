all is a great time to live in Vermont. This is Elena's first real Autumn, and she's an instant fan. The trees lighting on fire, the wind turning brisk, lighting the fire for the first time, discovering apple cider, orchard picking, apple cider donuts, and the lit coals of pumpkins sitting listless in their fields; it's all the sort of thing that's easy to take for granted until you bring in a loved one raised in a tropical environment. We went to an apple orchard today, and there was a school field trip in ful swing there. I must have gone on a dozen similar trips in my youth, but it was all so novel and delightful to my wife.

Apple cider donuts really do take the cake. And St. Edmund apples taste just like pears...
