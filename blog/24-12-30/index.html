he Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine is really something. It leaps up from the asphalt of a town of 50,000, on the scale of European cathedrals, an immense granite block, replete with genuinely beautiful stained glass, lovely statuary, and harmonious detailing throughout. We showed up half an hour early to the Latin Mass, and were very pleased to see yet another healthy community of pious young families springing up in the fertle soil of the traditional rite, bolstered by the wonderful architecture around them. I'm extremely curious about what American Catholicism is going to look like in 20, 50, 100 years; I think our nascent revivalist spirit is going to be a force to be reckoned with.
