've never really sung in a full choir before (at least as an adult). I've been singing in my schola now for years, and absolutely adore it. But there's something <i>special</i> about participating in a full, four-part harmony of more variety and complexity, like I was able to tonight. I was practicing the bass part by myself for a few week beforehand, so I was familiar with the music, but wasn't really prepared but the feeling of cooperative one-ness that comes from making music together in that way. It's funny -- when I was in a band, the idea of doing covers was completely unappealing to me. I was here to write music, not copy other people! But I'm developing an appreciation for being able to <i>embody</i> the musical ideas of another person, especially in concert with others striving for excellence.

I'm immensely grateful for the choir director we had, who amusingly was one of the youngest people in attendance -- a junior in college. But he's exteremely knowledgeable about music, excited about expressing what's present within the text, and a charismatic leader. I will certainly be present at the next festival.
