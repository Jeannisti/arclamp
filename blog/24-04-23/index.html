atched Fight Club for the first time in a very long while with wife, who had never seen it before. It's crazy seeing just how much of an effect that film had on the world, and also on my early adult life. I spent my childhood and teenage years fairly insulate from the adult world, and critiques of modernity like those from Fight Club had no resistance in the form of actual experience with everyday life. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I was going have to do get a job, in no small part because of the semi-lessons I learned from that movie.

<p>
But while society is just as consumerist as it was in 1999, so much of the echoes of Fight Club can be heard reverberating around the culture. Fascinatingly, its words can show up in both the radical left, and the alt-right, and it gives form to a lot of the plaintive cries of men in our country even 25 years later.

It is still a very well-made movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again. Does kind of make me want to get punched in the head.
