esmond Doss pulled 75 wounded soldiers off Hacksaw Ridge. He attributed his heroics directly to God. Our temptation is to call this humility, and maybe if we are being uncharitable, even <i>false</i> humility. "Other men did not do this; they <i>could</i> not have done this. There was something in Doss's nature that gave him the strength and courage to do what he did."
</p>
<p>
Doss, whether he says it explicitly or not, counters this claim. He is saying, precisely, that <i>any</i> man could have done what he did, because he was simply allowing himself to be used by God.
</p>
<p>
"But it was Doss's religious upbringing and particular experiences that gave him the disposition to cooperate with God, then. His actions were still beyond those of ordinary people."

No. If you ask sincerely, if you go to Him with real faith, right now, in this very moment, He will change you. He will make you capable of moving mountains. He will unlock every door. Living a Godly life is its own reward -- it is not training for the future calamity. God chooses who He wills, and any might respond to His choice.
