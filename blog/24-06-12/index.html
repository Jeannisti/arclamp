ime in baby-land flows a <i>lot</i> differently than in the normal, saecular world. You're simply operating on a different clock, one where the time between the minutes is never the same. You can't leave your wife alone for too long, but you don't know what "too long" is. Sometimes, everything is easy, and other times you cannot figure out at all what you have to do next. Hours collapse into dust and are swept away. How long has it been since he ate? How long since he pooped? How long has he been asleep? It's impossible to know. Like in a psychedelic delirium, everything is infused with meaning, and basic tools for differentiating time and place break down. And I even have language-informed conceptualization to help me piece things together; Lord knows what the little man himself thinks of it all.
