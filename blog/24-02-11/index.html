ake it all out, and put it back in again. When you're accumulating your Things in real time, you find a spot that looks good, and you stuff it in there, and that works until it doesn't anymore. Every time you go to stuff one more Thing in there, your stress level ticks a little higher. You regret putting that one Thing in that place, but now there are three more Things on top of it, and it isn't going anywhere. It's full to bursting, stacked crazy, perched to fall, and you've got to get something Big in there. And you know it can fit. Do you just push and shove and hope and pray and probably break someThing else?

I've had to take it all out and put it all back in again several times in the last week, and boy is it ever satisfying every time. It's so hard to convince yourself to undo your Unholy Mess, but with everything you've learned about stuffing and putting and placing and packing, you're so much better at it the second time around. Get it all out there. Put the Big Things in First. And be free.
