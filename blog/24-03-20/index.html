verybody has a different crop of disney movies that they grew up with. I've seen a lot of them, obviously, but there are a few that I remember being watched over and over again, and some which struck me particularly deeply. My mom tells me that I wanted to watch The Beauty and the Beast over and over and over again as a child, which is interesting, since it doesn't hold a particularly favored place in my memories now; it probably deserves a re-watch at this point, it's been a <i>long</i> time. Obviously the Lion King was basically on repeat, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame left some deep marks. But the ones that seem to glow the most for me in retrospect are not necessarily the most popular ones -- I just adored Mulan, and Treasure Planet, and Lilo and Stitch (though my wife hates the latter). 101 Dalmatians also gets pride of place, the style of its animation is just incredible.

Disney's been making movies for a long time, but I have well and truly stopped paying attention. I just can't get myself to care in the slightest about their computer-animated films. It feels like a betrayal of what the company was built on, what they defined themselves in achieving. But, thankfully for posterity, all those old films still exist, and we can go back to enjoy the work of those geniuses whenever we please. I should probably dig back in there again. I'll have a little child to show them to soon...
