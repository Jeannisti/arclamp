his has been a special Christmas, continuing on the theme established by yesterday's post. The celebration was broader -- there were many new faces, many families brought together. There was snow on the ground, and Christmas jazz standards were on the speaker. Mass was small and quiet. It is a good time to be walking around alive; the infant has arrived.
