raise be to the Lord, I got a lot done today. I got up early, hooked my trailer up to my car to take to my mom's place; grouted her bathroom floor, dry fit the vanity, did a dump run with the trailer (first time using it), did a Lowe's run, ran home, polished off a few sundries, played some Go, solved a few problems in Blackletter's design, and finished a new terrain model that I now can't stop looking at. I've written before about Good Busy. Good Busy's better than most Just Chillins, as far as I'm concerned. That may have something to do with the frenetic state of my soul, frankly, that I'd rather be constantly occupied than exposed to boredom and the barrenness of my inner life. But, I still am intrigued by the differences between Good Busy and Bad Busy -- cuz boy, does Bad Busy ever suck. What can transform the one into the other? An important question, I should think. On a normal day, I'm adamant that I need some time to <i>rest</i>, to take a load off -- but today, I was go-go-go from 6am to 10:30pm, and I still feel good now, as I sit in bed writing this. I guess sitting at a desk painting miniatures could qualify as relaxation (I was certainly looking forward to it), but it had a very active quality, very different from, say, watching a bunch of youtube videos.

It's always nice when a Good Busy comes along. We'll see what tomorrow brings.
