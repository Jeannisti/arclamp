<p>
lena's family was visiting from Guatemala all last week, many of them seeing Vermont for the first time. There were a number of things that they and Elena saw that they'd assumed existed only in movies, and all of them were very entertaining to me. I record several of them here:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Children running lemonade stands
</li>
<li>
Pogo sticks
</li>
<li>
Propellor hats
</li>
<li>
Diners
</li>
<li>
Police actually enforcing speed limits
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You never realize you're living in a movie until somebody points it out to you.
