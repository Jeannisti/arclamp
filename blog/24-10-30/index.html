oday was a day where I was worried I wasn't going to be able to fit in all the things I needed to do, and then I did. I also got paid by two separate clients, so my bank account's looking a lot nicer than it did a few hours ago. It feels really good to be working again. I love the variety that my job gives me -- a little bit of emailing, a little bit of research, picking up supplies, making sales, digging holes, installing showers; it's hard to get bored. Primero Dios, I'll get to keep doing this job for years to come.
