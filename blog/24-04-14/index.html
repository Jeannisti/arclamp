've embroiled some friends in my terrible obsession. At the Church potluck today, I called over my friend Michael and tested him: "Do the words 'Imperium of Man' mean anything to you?" Grinning warily, he answered, "Yes... why?" As it turns out, he's ripe for being thrown into the grim darkness of the forty-first millennium, having played a couple of the video games, and been attracted to the lore. Now, next Sunday, I'll be introducing at least two or three new people to Blackletter, as apparently the Church is having a board game club meeting. I worry that if any early teenagers see my bitchin' space warrior nuns, we're going to have a church-wide 40k problem very quickly. I can't help it that this terrible future galaxy is so cool.

Now I have a bunch of work to do to make my game presentable. Fortunately, this is the kind of work I love. I should probably get a little more paint on my tiny plastic dolls too...
