<p>
t's hard to have structured time these days, when my attention can be urgently called at any minute. You have to build little strategies to deal with it.
</p>
<p>
I like to wake up at least an hour before I leave for work, preferably two. In the past, this would be time for drinking coffee and essentially goofing off, reading blog posts online and watching youtube videos. But, reading articles and watching youtube videos is actually something that I <i>can</i> do with unstructured time -- I can set them down at a moment's notice to attend to other things. So, I shouldn't be wasting the time in the early morning before my son wakes up doing these things, I should be using that time proactively to take care of certain things that are harder to find the time for during the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Which is to say, I'm trying to read books again in the morning, and get some Go problems studied, and mess around with learning the fretboard of the guitar, and ideally writing a little. I'm very much a morning person, that first couple of coffee and a little task to occupy me is my favorite time of day; but it's lately been slipping a little as I go to bed later perhaps than I ought. We're making progress though.
