ndrei Rublev is an incredible film, and seeing it in theater on the initiative of my best friend was absolutely <i>the</i> way to see it for the first time. The cinematography is striking throughout, but the second half of the movie is just filled with incredibly powerful scenes, including the best use of tension and release I have ever seen on film.
</p>
<p>
While it is three hours long, it probably does bear re-watching. It's the sort of film whose themes I want to see stitched together properly, everything in its right place. And being able to wait for the climax again sounds excellent.
</p>
<p>
It's about inner transformation, and how little control we have over what we are eventually to become. Our fates are in Another's hands; and all we can do is pray that whatever is making us willl eventually use us for beauty.
