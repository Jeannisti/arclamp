he day kinda got me by the balls when I started out, but I got it back under control, and it turned out exceedingly well. It was beautiful out, I nearly finished the porch project I'm working on, had a couple of art classes and then shoved models around on a table with my wife. I finally found a paint scheme that I like for my new tiny space bugs, and I can't stop thinking about them all day. It will be a great day when I have a whole horde painted.

Some game design issues in Blackletter cropped up in the car today. It's pretty interesting how I'm able to think through design in my head, without having to explicitly playtest -- I can just <i>see</i> the essence of the game, I can shuffle around its contours and see how things stack up. This is an extremely useful ability when you're spending 3 hours in the car, and don't have that many people to playtest with. The first draft of the rules is just about finished, and I'll start shifting into graphic design phase. I hope that part doesn't drive me too crazy.
