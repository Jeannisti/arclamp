azenbozo writes on his blog about <a href="https://zazenbozo.com/11-09-24">the icons he is making</a>. Apparently, he has received some second-hand criticism from traditional icon-makers that his priest knows.
</p>
<p>
I like the laser-cut icons that he is making, and agree that not everything has to be done in the same way it has always been done. On the other side of the nave, we Catholics are known for our reverential treatment of somewhat schlocky mass-produced religious iconography. We also make works of unutterably genius and beauty -- it's the universal Church, after all.
</p>
<p>
But I also want to send encouragement Zazenbozo's way to consider deeply what he <i>can</i> learn from the strictly traditional iconographers. It's true that not everyone has the same amount of time or resources or techniques to pour into the works of their hands. However, I think any Christian can agree that <i>sacrifice</i> on the part of the artist elevates the art, and allows the art to become expressive of a deeper relationship with God.
</p>
<p>
While Zazenbozo's laser-cutting technique is hardly mass-produced (he gold-leafs them by hand afterward, and can his laser-cutter can only handle one icon at a time), I think it would be worth his time to reflect on the ways the he might be able to imbue his works with more devotion, inspired by the practices of real iconographers. On the scale from factory-printed plastic icons to hand-painted traditionalism, his pieces are still closer to the factory than the monk, especially considering that the images themselves are taken directly from other artists.
</p>
<p>
Again, not everything has to be Rublev or Michaelangelo. But, especially when it comes to religious art, it's worth reflecting on <i>why</i> we are doing it in the first place, and trying to find the means that are most cohesive with our ends. Know that this is just light criticism, Bozo! They really are cool, and I'm envious that you have found a way to make beautiful things in your faith, something I (a one-time professional artist) have struggled to do for years. I also believe that he does fast while he is designing them, which is surely a good practice.
