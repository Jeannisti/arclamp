he miracles started when the Librarian fell from the stratosphere, embedding his power armor three meters into the earth. Several people were lifted bodily into the heavens in ecstasy almost immediately. The entire town was consumed with fervor. The giant was dead, or at least not alive in our sense, but his saintly strength continued to infuse the entire countryside with a deep, sacred resonance. There were none, especially in those first few days, who did not feel the touch of the Emperor's love deep in their hearts, and spontaneous smiles worked their way to the lips of the even the most bitter folk. It was some time before the town worked out how to remove the armor and its holy corpse from the crater, and by then things were starting to return to a semblance of order. But all knew that something irrevocable had changed in their home, and anyone passing another in the street could see it in their eyes, like a shared and happy secret. Of course, it was only a matter of time before the Inquisition got wind of what had happened, and dispatched an Auditor to the clarify the matter.
