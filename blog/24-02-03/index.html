eceived a lot of love today in the form of help around the house. E---- and I are in our own home, and there's a lot to be done to really burrow ourselves in and feel truly comfortable, as a new family. K----, our neighbor, and my father came by, to deep-clean and organize the kitchen, and lay new flooring in our bedroom upstairs, respectively. I love these sorts of friendly days of work around the house, with concrete goals to accomplish, and good cheer to sustain it. We got a lot done, and the small foundations we laid today will support a great deal of peace and memories in the future. I want to maintain the desire to be putzing around and improving things in the house for as long as I can, like a Spring Cleaning sprung a little early. My friends J---- and E---- were absolute machines in their dedication to getting their new home up to snuff, keeping steady work going for more than a year. May they continue to inspire me.
