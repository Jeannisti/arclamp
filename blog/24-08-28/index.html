've been wearing the same glasses for 15 years, and I just found out that my prescription hasn't changed in all that time, which is kind of nice. I also went through an extraordinary rigmarole trying to pick up a roll of flashing at Lowe's, which took wholly 40 minutes longer than it should have, but ended with me receiving a $75 item for absolutely free, which was well worth my time. The various organs of Lowe's were grinding terribly, and the several ladies behind the customer service counter, Brianna, Lata, Melinda, and Nina, put themselves at great pains to resolve my situation. In which task they succeeded, I walked away a happy man.

This has been, and continues to be, a busy week -- several projects are all coming together at once, and I'm trying to give them the energy they need. Yesterday was hard, today was a lot better. I'm staying on top of things; even this blog, though I'm something like ten days behind. The way to get out of debt is to stop adding to the debt. Bit by bit, I'll chip away at what I owe.
