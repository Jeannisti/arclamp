 word of advice: never, ever have hot takes. I haven't been alive for all that long, so I can't speak for what the media landscape looked like in the past, nor surmise about its ups and downs. But I can tell you this -- in this day and age, if you hear a "breaking" news story that is Big and Important and demands Immediate Response, I can practically guarantee that is has been misreported, that it is far more complicated than it is being let on (if it happened at all), and that more than half the facts of the matter will be found to change over the course of the next six weeks or so (if anyone were still bothering to check). This is even more true if you find that the story is confirming a large number of your priors (that is, the story is confirming that the Bad People are bad, and the Good People are good).
</p>
<p>
Just don't respond. Don't post about it on social media. Don't rage about it to your friends. If you are very brave and graceful, you may ask questions. But really, I advise you to wait. Wait for a few weeks, and check back in. See if you can find any opposing sources. See if there is anything that cuts against the initial surge of interpretation. Over the course of the last several years, it has happened again and again and again, that the Big Story of the moment has turned out to be stuff and nonsense, or to be the exact opposite of what was initially touted, or to be an impenetrable fog of confusion that no disinterested person would dare to pronounce upon. But the firestorm moves on, finds something else to drum up interest, and has no follow-through, no regard for correcting itself.
</p>
<p>
Embrace the fact that you have no power. Your voice is just one in a teeming mass, and throwing one more cry of outrage into the cacophany will do no good; but a habit of making outraged cries can do your own soul a great deal of harm. Insert some lag into your understanding of current events. Only check the news once a week (or once a month). If something important happens, you'll find out sooner and later, and it is a near-certainty that <i>nothing</i> hinges upon your knowing about it in a timely manner. There are an infinite number of evils in this world; don't base your responses to them purely off of the nuggets thrown out to make some media baron a little wealthier off your "engagement".
