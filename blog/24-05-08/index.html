<p>
here's a giant boulder sitting in the woods on my land. I climbed up on top of it, slipping on the moss and roots that have grown over it. At the top, there's a crevice that had filled up with plant matter that had slowly turned into dirt. There were worms in the dirt -- how did they get there? There was no consistent "highway" of dirt from the forest floor to the top of the boulder, but there were several happy worms digging around in this dirt island. A group of them (or maybe just one, originally) must have made quite the cross-country journey, struggling blind over moss and stone to reach the promised land, 60 inches above the ground they'd known. How many generations now had lived on Dirt Island, and known nothing more than the square foot or so of rich black dirt up there in the heavens?

I did destroy Dirt Island, I'm afraid. I'm gonna use that boulder for something. The worms will be fine on the ground, they'll never know the difference.
