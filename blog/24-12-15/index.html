uman beings are primarily distinctive for being rational amongst the animals, but another of our unusual traits is how good we are at throwing things. Some animals can spit pretty accurately, but human beings take the cake for launching projectiles long distances and with great accuracy on a completely intuitive level. Throwing as a physical skill is extremely natural to us, though it escapes the capabilities of just about every other creature.
</p>
<p>
Many of our special powers are a direct result of being rational creatures (such as our abilities to draw, to remember, to do math, perhaps to make music), but throwing does not seem to be one of these. Being able to throw seems independent of rationality, strictly speaking; we could easily imagine a rational animal that was not very good at throwing, though it would be difficult to imagine a one that could not add.

I had a little thought experiment where I tried to imagine some <i>other</i> strange physical skill that some hypothetical rational animal could excel at on an intuitive level, that humans being aren't much good at; I came up with knot-tying. Humans are garbage at understanding knots. We struggle to untie large bundles of wires, we have to practice over and over again to learn even basic knots, and we are hopeless at telling at a glance whether a particular string is tied in a "true knot" (will not come untied if you pull both ends) or a "false knot" (only looks like a true knot, but is unstable). It would be neat to meet a species for whom throwing objects accurately was like magic, but who could understand and tie all manner of complicated knots without even thinking about it.
