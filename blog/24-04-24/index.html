<p>
ear the end of the story of Daniel, when he has been cast to the lions, there is an alarming twist to the story. We suddenly see a man named Habacuc, who is taking food out to workers in the field, far from Babylon, where Daniel is being persecuted. An angel of the Lord appears to Habacuc, and tells him to take the food to Daniel, in the lion's den in Babylon. Habacuc replies that he has never heard of Daniel, and does not know where Babylon is. The angel then seizes Habacuc by his hair, and lifts him bodily all the way to Babylon, depositing him in front of Daniel. Habacuc prostrates himself, and tells Daniel the food he bears is for him. Daniel takes it, and Habacuc is placed back where he came from. Daniel goes on to tame the lions, and his persecutors are put to death.
</p>
<p>
Why did Daniel need the food of Habacuc so badly? What was the rest of Habacuc's life like, having borne such terrifying witness to the works of the Lord, and briefly serving one of his great prophets? There is a minor prophet whose name is also Habacuc, and many believe it to be the same man, which is a lovely thought -- that this lowly man was dragged into prophetic service of God, unable to return to his old life after what he had seen.
