rying to develop humility is like a zen koan, or a delicate paradox you try to hold in your head. Everything about our human nature bucks against it, pride can easily disguise itself as it, it is both ambitious and the opposite of ambition. But I do genuinely believe it is attainable by anyone, in any station of life. I'm trying to find out what humble Jack looks like; how do I act when I am in voluntary submission to the Lord's will at all times?

I think I myself have a temptation towards intentionally making mistakes (or subconsciously doing so) as a substitute for humility. While this certainly puts me in humbling situations, I think the real target is to be genuinely trying your best, but sincerely holding tight to the belief that all good things come from God, and that without Him, all our works shall come to naught. When I succeed, I feel like <i>I</i> did it. How can I get myself to understand that these are <i>God's</i> successes?
