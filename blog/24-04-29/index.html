 kind of forgot how much I like going to bed early and waking up early. For a while there I was turning into an 11pm sleeper, which doesn't sound late, but there was a time when I was going to bed at 8 in order to wake up at 4, so I could have 2 hours of morning-time before I had to leave for work at 6. I have a distance to drive these days (which means I have to be away from wife for longer, which suck, but means I get a lot of concentrated thinking time, which is kind of nice), so in order to get any work done at the site at all, I have to leave pretty freaking early. I'm getting back into the swing of a 9pm sleep schedule, and waking up before the sun has risen yet. What's next is re-developing my good morning habits. Right now, I basically just read internet blogs for an hour while my coffee peps me up, but I think I can do better. A morning walk in the woods, and a real, honest-to-God book might do the trick. Ahh, I only have two weeks or so before baby puts all my best laid sleep plans out to pasture.
