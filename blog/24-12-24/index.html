e had Christmas Eve plans to get together at our home with the family, but those kind of went by the wayside because of how out of the way we are (and the pending Christmas party the following day). So instead we, spur of the moment, invited out friend Michael and our neighbor Karena over for a little Christmas Eve dinner. It turned out to be an incredibly special night. I've spent basically every Christmas time solely with family, and mostly just my immediate family. This Christmas Eve felt like something out of a nineteenth-century English novel; two sisters-in-law and a couple folks who were going to be alone for the Eve, all coming together for turkey in the midst of the frozen snow. Our home felt so warm and welcoming, I don't remember a Christmas Eve quite like it. We decorated the tree together, lit it up after dinner, and talked into the night. Praise the infant!
