e burned the devil tonight. Four families, plus our friend Michael came together to light the fire, sing hymns, pray, light fireworks, and eat food together. We're so blessed to have this community so close to us, and I think we have the opportunity to do something special with it. A group of people united in faith, still young and full of energy, all this close to one another; it makes me excited for the future. Anything that's going to last needs to be shared -- no family is an island. I hope we're able to help one another grow in faith, in charity, in hope.
