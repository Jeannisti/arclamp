etting slammed with snow again tonight. And tomorrow. And the next day. Elena and I are bundling up and getting ready for another snow day (or two). Literally just yesterday, it was 60 degrees out, and I was walking around outside in bare feet, taking stock of my Spring projects, and swinging my axes around a bit. Actually, I'm glad I haven't gotten out too much in this proto-Spring, or I'd have been liable to be genuinely disappointed at not being able to get back into the swing of my tasks. As it stands, instead I'm looking forward to a day of drawing and miniature painting. It's going to kick ass, so I guess I'll do my best not to complain too hard. Our house is really starting to come together these days, and I'll take any excuse I can get to hang out in it with my lovely wife.
