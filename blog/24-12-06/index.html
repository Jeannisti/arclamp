<p>
'm becoming preoccupied once again with the INvisible World. It's been popping up again, here and there.

<blockquote>
These carols sung to cheer my passage through the world I see,
For completion I dedicate to the Invisible World.
-- Walt Whitman

<blockquote>
Only through prayer can we turn from the visible to the invisible.
-- Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev, 1966

What is the invisible world? I remember when I was in college, I was obsessed with spiritual enlightenment; with understanding that which undergirds all things. After a long time, and many seismic interior shake-ups, the interest is returning. How do we turn from the world of appearances, to the world that we cannot see? What, exactly, am I talking about?
