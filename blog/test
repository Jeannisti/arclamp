e went from nothing happening on the Fourth of July to having an impromptu party of nine people very quickly today. This is one of my favorite ways for things to happen, just schedules happening to line up, and convergence occurring naturally. It's especially nice when the convergence happens at my house, and I don't have to go anywhere. There were a thousand dogs and two babies, and I loved everyone.
