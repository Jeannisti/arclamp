ohn Antonio made his first trip to Isbell Cottage this week, a place that I'm sure will be an important part of his childhood. The Summer mood was exultant, and the lake was still a cold balm against the heat. I got very excited about the season up there, and about the future of my family. Three generations got to be there for the first time, the first of many. It felt very, very good.
