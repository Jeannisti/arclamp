<p>
 finally got my scythe up and working this year, to at least a tolerable degree, and am greatly looking forward to spending a lot of time in the sun swinging a three-foot blade. The weather is truly morphing into some classic Vermont Summer, and I spent a lot of time outside for really the first time today and yesterday. The grass is being pushed back into obedience, though there's still a <i>ton</i> to do, at least I'm getting into the mood.

I'm not a very good finisher of projects. I like the opening stages of new work, but definitely struggle on my follow-through. Knowing this about myself means that I have a tendency not to take on super-ambitious projects, because I know they'll languish and likely be abandoned. This is something I greatly admire in Eli, that he can force himself, kicking and screaming, to complete something if he's started it. I need to channel that energy a bit, and stay focused on something until it's done. Right now, I'm thinking about my chicken coop as the primary suspect, but this goes on in all sorts of places. Just nose to the grindstone, and finish something before moving onto the next thing.

I have the kind of mind that enjoys shifting gears, stepping lightly from one train of thought, and one series of actions to the next. My favorite days are the ones where I have the freedom to idly switch between reading, mowing the lawn, painting miniatures, writing, playing games, and so on and so forth. It's unclear to me to what degree this is a personal failing. It keeps me happy and motivated, I get a broad swath of experience and activity, but I don't exactly wow people with my output or raw skills. Honestly, it probably merits prayer to do a little discerning. There's a <i>real</i> habit to develop...
