re Christians called to strict non-violence? Zazen Bozo and I have been discussing this subject off and on for a couple of weeks now. I do not actually have what I would call a strictly settled opinion on this matter -- personally, I find the teaching of strict pacifism to be "easier" on my own conscious; it is very simple, accords with many of my personal scruples and theological leanings, and I myself am fairly unlikely to ever violate this particular commandment. However, I think that scriptural and traditional evidence for how Christians treat this subject is complicated, and does not admit an obvious reading.
</p>
<p>
What is the evidence in favor of pacifism from scripture? Resist not evil, and turn the other cheek. Blessed are the peacemakers. Thou shalt not kill. Many of the early Church Fathers understood these passages to mean that Christians were not permitted to take a life under any circumstances. Is this the final word, however?
</p>
<p>
First of all, it needs to be said that many, many doctors and saints of the Church have defended at least certain forms of violence, in certain situations, by certain agents. These are people who dedicated their lives to God, and knew as much about scripture, prayer, and the inner life as anyone who has ever lived. Right off the bat, this testimony indicates to me that I cannot assume a simple, obvious answer to this question without rejecting the whole of my Catholic Tradition. I am required, as a disciple (which, to be clear, means student) of Christ to apply myself to the task of understanding scripture, tradition, and my own conscience. The method and extent of this effort is different for each person according to their proclivities and strengths, but for those with studious minds, those minds <i>must be put to work</i> in the service of God.
</p>
<p>
So; is there scriptural evidence against the pacifist interpretation? Jesus tells us he brings a sword, and will set brother against brother; and tells his disciples to make sure that they have several swords amongst them. Jesus himself uses a weapon to drive people out of the temple of Jerusalem. The Old Testament is replete with many, many examples of the chosen people of God being commanded, or given blessing, to engage in war with their foes. Evidence that Jesus' commandment to turn the other cheek should not be understood literally comes from Jesus being struck while in the Jewish court, and rather than offering to be struck again, defends himself verbally and legally, arguing that the blow was unjust (a similar scene happens with St. Paul while in a Jewish court). Jesus uses parables in which good kings put their enemies to death, and uses those kings as a figure of God. And then there are witnesses of the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, and their various understandings of just war, the death penalty, self defense, and so on and so forth.
</p>
<p>
I do not claim, on the basis of this latter evidence, that it is clear that Jesus does <i>not</i> command strict pacifism. I am perfectly aware that there is a counterargument for every one of the previously cited objects. Rather, <i>that</i> is my point -- that they all <i>require</i> counterargument, they require interpretation. I am not a Kierkegaardian; I do not think that the precise meaning of scripture is plain, and I think there is in fact a temptation to seize on fundamentalist readings of certain passages, while ignoring those in tension with them, in order to have the Word of God be conveniently, blindingly obvious. It is not obvious, which is why St. Paul wrote endless epistles explaining the meaning of scripture to dozens of churches. It is why theology exists in the first place, and why we accept spiritual teachers, and read spiritual texts.
</p>
<p>
So I don't have a knock-down argument right here, right now, one way or the other on Christian pacifism. At present, I think that Christians should strive for peace whenever possible, and should always seek to use forgiveness to mitigate strife, rather than engaging in endless retributive violence (which, so we're clear, is the historical human norm). But I also believe that defending others can, and often is, an important Christian virtue; and that there are certain times when violence is justified, either by individuals or by governments. This is what the Catholic faith teaches, and I must defer to it, and seek to understand her arguments. That is what a good servant does.
