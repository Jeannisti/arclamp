ll I can think about is Blackletter, which is the potential name of the miniature game I'm designing. I have something of an obsessive personality, and a very actively-churning mind, and it has officially been engaged by something extremely pleasing. I'm extremely happy with how the game is progressing -- it's accomplishing virtually all the goals that I set out for it at the outset, and those targets that remain feel within reach. I keep running over the results of the matches I've played, keep calculating the statistics of various numbers I could set, keep imagining ways to stylize the pdf, or improve the flow. Even just re-thinking thoughts that I have already thought is downright <i>enjoyable</i>.
</p>
<p>
Being a pretty interally-oriented person, this kind of enjoyment comes around every so often, where all I want to do is think about the Thing, whatever that thing is. And it leads me to wonder -- what is it that I'm enjoying? Why do I get such a kick over particular kinds of thoughts? I admit, that at times it even feels a little perverse; not in the sense that what I'm thinking about is by any means <i>bad</i>, but that I shouldn't be getting so much pleasure out of such vain things. We all have the things that we <i>want</i>, and then we have the things that we <i>want to want</i>. The same goes for my mental habits.
</p>
<p>
I have a suspicion that many of the great saints have had a similar internal disposition, but that their enjoyment is turned toward the God of all creation, the God of mercy. I suspect that they just <i>want</i> to be thinking about the Lord -- they want to be talking about Him, advancing their understanding of Him, in the same way that I want to be thinking vainly about games. Generally, masters of any art are probably infused with this attitude, of the inner life caught almost in a whirl of desire for contemplation. And I wonder -- what would it take to undergo a great <i>re-</i>orientation? What would I have to do to desire the spiritual life in the same way that I meditate on my personal fetishes? This, I think, is food for thought, and for prayer.
