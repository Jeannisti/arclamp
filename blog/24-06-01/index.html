topped by Roby's Place today for some light flooring action. Roby can sit and smile and hold cups and be a little chunk. She's extremely cute, and throws into relief how much of a difference there is between a "baby" and a "newborn". Obviously, they're all a bunch of babies, but newborns really are of a different stripe from their more slightly ambulatory futures. The physical differences and abilities are one thing, but the way that Roby pays attention, and is able to sync into social cues is really remarkable compared to my little boy, who still can't really hold onto smiles, and can't focus on much.

But babies ain't stupid. I've been experimenting with trying to get John "potty-trained", which in this case means getting him to pee while I hold him over the tub, and it's been remarkably successful. This three-week old is barely dropping anything in his diaper anymore, and is extremely responsive to his potty-pose. When I first heard about diaper-less infancy, I really did assume it would take a <i>lot</i> of work, but it turns out babies take to it pretty well (or, one of 'em does anyway). Nobody likes shitting their pants.
