<p>
 swear you just schedule these appointments up as a joke. Well, clothes off, Mr. 'Smith', let's get down to it. How are you feeling these days? You're not a young man anymore; any aches or pains starting to crop up?"
</p>
<p>
"Nothing. Hale as a horse. It's just a regular check-up, doctor; don't want the insurance going to waste."
</p>
<p>
"Mm. I notice you only seem to need them when things are slow around here. Don't want to be wasting my time when I could be seeing actually sick people, I imagine?"
</p>
<p>
"Humor me. Everyone needs a check-up every now and then."
</p>
<p>
"Don't they though. Alright, have you picked up smoking since last time?"
</p>
<p>
"No, sir."
</p>
<p>
"How many drinks a week?"
</p>
<p>
"I don't drink."
</p>
<p>
"Of course not. Are your vaccines up to date? ...no, I suppose they wouldn't be."
</p>
<p>
"I did try, once or twice."
</p>
<p>
"I wouldn't want to see the needle that could do it. Alright, up on the table, relax the legs. And...now the other... yes, don't know why I bother. Nothing."
</p>
<p>
"You could try a real hammer."
</p>
<p>
"Always the joker. Open the mouth and say aaa."
</p>
<p>
"Aaa."
</p>
<p>
"Hmm. Remarkably ordinary. Very well. Let's take a look at the peepers... as expected. No contraction whatsoever. We can go down the list, Mr. Smith, but I think we both know what we'll find. And what we can't find."
</p>
<p>
"It makes me feel better just to have someone take a look. I hope I'm not wasting your time."
</p>
<p>
"Today, I'm <i>made</i> of time. Now, what you're made of is another story. I thank God you're not over 50 yet, and we can dispense with attempting a prostate exam. You would find that funny, wouldn't you."
</p>
<p>
"Not as funny as you think, doctor. Sometimes, actually, I do worry about it."
</p>
<p>
"About cancer? Plenty for some folks to worry about, but I should hope not you."
</p>
<p>
"That's it though, isn't it? How would I know? What could I <i>do</i> if I did know?"
</p>
<p>
"Mm. I'd advise not thinking about it too much. You've been through a great deal, and still appear just about the healthiest man alive. But... well, yes. I do still have the X-rays from last time."
</p>
<p>
"The man in black."
</p>
<p>
"Indeed. 'The human silhouette'. You must think of it from time to time, Mr. 'Smith' -- the great mystery inside you? The impenetrable dark. An unremarkable exterior, but frankly...inside, who knows."
</p>
<p>
"Not a comforting thought. But...one I've entertained from time to time. Let's hope everything's alright in there. All the strength in the world isn't worth much without your health."
</p>
<p>
"Wise words. Let's just say, I wouldn't start smoking. Best to be on the safe side. Anyway, I think this particular charade's gone on long enough. Stop worrying; doctor's orders. Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. 'Smith'?"
</p>
<p>
"Thoughts and prayers?"
</p>
<p>
"I'll put you on the list."
