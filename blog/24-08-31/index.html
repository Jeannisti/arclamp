y father and I marathon-sessioned a new bathroom into my house today. He showed up around 10am, and left around 8pm. When he got here, we had a featureless 6x8 room. Now it has flooring, a vanity, and toilet, all hooked up with plumbing lines that didn't exist when the sun rose. It was hugely fun, and we have something very concrete to show for our efforts, which feels great. I still have to finish the drywalling, which was abandoned halfway through by this house's previous owners, but that's not the end of the world. I'm still a terrible drywaller, but I'm getting very interested in the idea of being good at it -- the principles have been made clear to me, at least.

It's been a very busy week, and I've been exhausted at the end of almost every day. But that's how it's supposed to be. If you aren't tired, you could have pushed a little harder that day. I think a lot of inner harm gets done to people who don't fill up their days with good work. Trust me about those idle hands.
