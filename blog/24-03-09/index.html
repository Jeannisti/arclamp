hy is Jesus worried about you? For a lot of people, God is Angry Dad -- he has set arbitrary rules, and expects them to be followed, under pain of terrible punishment. But this is an awful caricature. Every one of us is loved by the Lord more tenderly and dearly than any ever mother loved her child. He watches us, is patient with us, forgives us, protects us. He views us not with suspicion, but with hope and concern. The question is not "Is God angry with me?" but rather, "What am I doing that makes God worried for my well-being?"

There's an important distinction in Catholic moral theology between a venial sin and a mortal sin. Venial sin often gets described as "bad, but not too bad", while mortal sin represents a true rejection of the Divine Will, and as such requires us to reconcile ourselves to the Lord and beg His forgiveness, via the sacrament of Confession. But this description often makes it seem like venial sins are "1" on the scale, and mortal sins are "10". We can even fancy to ourselves that our venial sins are somehow "acceptable" to God, maybe even a <i>little</i> good if you look at them in the right way...

I think it's helpful to imagine venial sin as less "the stuff that doesn't really matter", and more as "concerning behavior", that if not checked, could lead to extremely destructive places. Furthermore, it's not that they're not bad -- it's that they're not <i>utterly</i> destructive of our relationship to God. I don't know how apt the metaphor is, but I think that venial sin is almost like <i>cutting</i> in troubled teenagers. Not bad enough to send you to the hospital, but extremely worrying, destructive of one's self, and in many ways an act of despair, whether one realizes it or not. God wants the best for us, and while it's not reasonable to expect ourselves to be able to completely eradicate venial sin from our lives, we need to understand it properly as a true impediment to growing in love of the Lord. He wants you to be free of sin for <i>your</i> sake, not for His.
