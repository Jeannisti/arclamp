<p>
ow do I sacrifice myself for Christ?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I must love that which is sacrificed.
</li>
<li>
That which is sacrificed must be standing between me and the Lord.
</li>
<li>
The sacrifice must be made with love as its true motivation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
What things fit this criteria? Money, surely, to an extent. But, as I often tell people, I value time more than money. So -- time, then. I spend a great deal of "my" time in pursuit of my own mild pleasures. These must be sacrificed.
</p>
<p>
At times I worry that I have sold my witness to the Faith in exchange for peace with my friends and family. I truly do not know if this is true or not. Many people who know me are more sympathetic to the Church than they were before my conversion. But have I made myself lukewarm in order to be palatable? Am I over-valuing peace in my familial affairs?
</p>
<p>
The purpose of Christian sacrifice is <i>not</i> to suffer. He who loses his life shall save it. It hurts at first -- but its fruit is joy. Can I heed my own words?
