<p>
 picked up a Frog and Toad book in a used clothing store today, and read the stories out loud to John. They made me laugh out loud, and made my voice quiver with tears at their simplicity, warmth, and humor. Eli was extolling the virtues of Frog and Toad a while ago, and he was absolutely right, they are marvels.

How is such a style achieved? The author Lobel is masterful in the way he presents events in a very straightforward manner, then juxtaposes them with a sudden turn, that draws out immense character and humor from a tiny number of words. And of course, the illustrations are beyond charming. Now, I have to acquire every Frog and Toad book, I suppose.
