hen I saw that my son's pediatrician was a naturopath and homeopathic doctor, I was definitely hoping that homeopathy was being referred to in some new, hip way. Like, he couldn't mean <i>that</i> homeopathy, right? The diluting-substances-in-water-until-there's-nothing-left one, from the eighteenth century? But I got the chance to clarify today, and that is in fact the homeopathy that he's talking about.

I have my own issues and thoughts about the conclusions of a variety of mainstream sciences, and I have plenty of beliefs that are unpopular in modern society. But I do have to draw my lines somewhere, and I'm not particularly happy to hear that he's so all-in on this quackery. He's sweet and attentive, and I think in general he's a fine doctor, but the foundation of trust has for sure been a bit rocked.
