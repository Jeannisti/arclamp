 don't see a lot of contemporary movies. Repeated experience with the modern cinematic world has left me pretty jaded about the whole thing. It's hard to put exactly into words, but something died in American cinema in the early- to mid-oughts, and people just don't seem to know how to make good, honest, enjoyable movies anymore. There are obviously exceptions to this rule, but boy oh boy, does it take a <i>lot</i> to get me excited about a movie these days.

This fall-off in quality has been associated with a disturbing increase in length, which only exacerbates the problem. Directors are attempting "ambitious" films, but the modern epic is typically bloated, lacking in personality, and stylistically mediocre. I do <i>not</i> want to sit through a 3-hour movie that isn't a literal masterpiece. Consequently, I haven't seen Oppenheimer, I haven't seen Dune, and I'm not going to see Napoleon. I'm sure these movies are fine! (Well, Napoleon less so) But fine just isn't enough. In keeping with my attitude on news, I assume all movies aren't worth seeing unless I hear some really stellar reviews from a small group of trusted friends. There are plenty of phenomenal films from the past I could be watching -- and modern directors have by and large lost my faith that the hours they ask of me will be well-invested.

That said, The Lighthouse was such a pleasant departure from this dreary norm. Just rewatched it with Elena the other night, and dang that movie slaps. Just a joy to watch and think about the entire way through. I have been forced -- Robery Eggers, I'll watch your next movie.
