t's late and we have to go <i>back</i> to Boston tomorrow. Here's hoping the trip is about five times easier this time. I went to Ben and Will's pseudo-birthday party, and got to see Jesse and Eila and Mason for the first time in years. I talked with Ben about chess, played Go with Kaylee, talked rock climbing with Zeke. It was nice, but I didn't get to spend enough time with my wife and child today, frankly. Luckily, tomorrow is a family road trip. That should make up for it, I think.
