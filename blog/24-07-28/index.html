<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 have a lot of anxiety about gardening. I have strong medium-term goals about homesteading on my property, but I have developed absolutely no green thumb over my lifetime, and find the prospect of beginning to learn the incredibly deep subject of how to encourage plants to grow a bit intimidating. I know I can get there, and that once I start it will stop feeling so big and scary; but I'm <i>really</i> not looking forward to my first several failed crops, and I'm <i>really</i> not looking forward to weeding.
</p>
<p>
Animal husbandry is also hard to envision starting, but mostly because of the up-front infrastructure needs. There's a principle (I forget what it's called) that work will always expand to fill the time alotted to it. What this means for me, who has no set time limit for anything, is that the work to do things like prepare for chickens or sheep will expand into infinity, and I'll just fiddle around forever.
</p>
<p>
Probably I should just order my animals, and force myself to scramble to get ready. From what I've seen of homesteaders, things snowball quickly, and inertia drags you more and more into the lifestyle. I just have to get started.
