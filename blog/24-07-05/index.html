oday was a particularly good day. I read in the morning, and came up with a new idea I'm excited to share. I worked a full day on the bathroom renovation I doing down the road; I had several tasks that were all semi-technical finish work, and all of them went off without a hitch. It was beautiful and sunny, and when I got home to my beautiful wife, I found my son smiling up at her. I went out to work on my chicken coop for the first time in months, and, having forgotten my chisels at work, decided to make lap-joints with nothing but saws and axes instead, which worked wonderfully. It felt so good to be working outside with hand tools again. These sorts of days are making me into a Summer person, year by year.
