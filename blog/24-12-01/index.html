ur church friends offered to have their children help us out with something, and we agreed. We're having a little festival soon in honor of Our Lady; in Guatemala, on the eve of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, it's traditional to burn an effigy of the devil, along with fireworks and various hijinks. We're inviting all our local church friends over for it, and we needed a devil. I drew up a little design sketch, gathered a bunch of scrap wood, and just told a fourteen-year-old and a twelve-year-old to get after it.

It was actually remarkable how closely their finished sculpture adhered to my sketch. They did an amazing job, and I love that they'll have gotten to contribute in this way to a public gathering. If this little festival sticks, I hope they'll take up the task again next year, and try to outdo themselves. Bravo, boys.
