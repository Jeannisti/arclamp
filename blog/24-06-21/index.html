<p>
 recently was fearing that the Summer was slipping through my very fingers, before I realized that Summer had not in fact even begun. It has now begun, and a background hum of anxious worries about projects necessary and unnecessary starting to reverberate in my mind. How would I do it all?
</p>
<p>
Then I took some time yesterday to write down <i>everything</i> I wanted to do within a reasonable timescale. And I realized, there actually isn't that much. A couple of the projects are pretty big, but the vast majority are accomplishable in an hour or two apiece. Having them all laid out on a single piece of paper really put it into perspective. With the exception of a couple biggies, I could probably cut this list down to almost nothing within a month; less, with a little focus and determination. That felt nice. Sometimes I fear getting more information, but it usually just puts things into perspective, and gives me a feeling of control of what's going on.
