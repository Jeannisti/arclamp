ntering more fully into genuine adulthood entails a lot of change. I like the distinction that children have others who are responsible for them, young adults are responsible for themselves, and full adults are responsible for others. Responsibility is a privilege, and one that historically was quite highly sought after. In our current rather shallow age, however, a great contingent of young people are trying urgently to avoid taking on responsibilities as much as possible, having completely misunderstood the nature of humanity, and believing that responsibilities can only mean deprivation of freedom. Certain freedoms are certainly lost by needing to care for others, but the rewards of purpose that one receives in recompense far outweigh the cost.

I am now a husband, and a father, and have intense responsibilities that cannot be ignored. One aspect of adulthood that I've always somewhat neglected, however, is that of <i>hospitality</i>, that most important of ancient virtues. I am a miserly person, always looking for ways to avoid spending money, and I have a tendency toward isolation out here on my idyllic property in the woods. But I know that I'm called to more than that -- that the skill of hosting, entertaining, and serving others is one that I would be well-served to develop.

We had our neighbors over for dinner tonight. Elena made stew and blueberry cobbler, and we talked about cars and woodstacking, and work and old acquaintances. It was really nice. John is an excellent host.
