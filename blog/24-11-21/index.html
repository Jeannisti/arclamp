ctively <i>doing</i> something together with friends is not an experience I get enough of in my life. It comes up from time to time -- coming together to help out with some home improvement or demolition project and playing games together spring to mind. But laboring together at a semi-long term project with a specific goal of excellence in mind is something I'd like to see more of.

We had my friend Michael over for dinner and to practice singing together for our upcoming concert tonight. We started out practicing, then ate, chatted for a while, and then got back to practicing. It felt excellent -- four hours passed in no time at all. The goal of improving our repertoire with the night gave a wonderful backbone to evening, and made the conversation around the dinner table all the more invigorating for being a break from cooperative work.

Michael's a great guy, and I hope we're able to get him out to our neck of the woods more often. We see eye-to-eye on a lot of things, and actually have a weirdly large number of things in common. The Lord has seen fit to continue blessing me with remarkable friendships, it seems.
