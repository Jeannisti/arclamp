<p>
his has been a long week. My work project is dragging on <i>way</i> longer than I wanted (my own fault), and Kelvin and Devin have been up helping me to film videos for Blackletter, and there's been a huge flood. This morning, though, I woke up late, spent the morning with Elena and John Antonio, took a walk together down to pick up the car, met a new neighbor (who also just got married last year; he and his wife are trying to get pregnant), and finally went to work late in the afternoon. Then, my post-work filming was canceled, so I started re-arranging the house, which is once again feeling much better. It always feels like there's room to improve a house, and shuffling things around always makes it seem so fresh.

It was a good reset day.
