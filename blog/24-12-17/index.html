<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 was talking with my friend Ben about work, and over the course of the conversation it was made clear to me just how much I need a change of situation with my work vehicle. Currently, I have a midsize SUV that doubles as my family car and my tool storage. Every time it switches duty, I have to move all of my tools out of the car and into my house, or vice versa. This blows, even beyond just the size and shape of the car being unsuitable for easy access.

I'm going to talk to another friend who has his own carpentry business what his strategy with vehicles is. But in the meantime, I started looking around at enclosed trailers. They're not <i>that</i> expensive, really; and a nice little 5x8 to keep everything together in one place; that sounds real nice.
