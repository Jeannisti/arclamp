'm growing to love digging into slightly longer-term projects than I used to tackle. I'm seeing this most prominently in the work I'm doing remodeling my mom's bathroom. I've been hacking at it for several weeks now, delayed by weather here, making a mistake there, plans changing and evolving as it comes together -- but I just love the feeling of entering an empty house, making a plan for myself, and slowing working through it, taking my time with what needs to be done, and bit by bit changing this little corner of the earth. When I worked for a carpentry company, I always looked forward to the days when I would be given my own personal task to accomplish -- I didn't mind working with others, exactly, but the time always flew when I was doing things alone, my way. Now, that's my whole job, and I just love it. I really need to get my shit together and keep finding clients, because I just really enjoy the work I've been doing up to now. I've been outrageously blessed to have generally enjoyed basically every job I've had since I left college -- none of them has made me outrageous amounts of money, but I've been getting by, and I'm hoping this one might be able to pay the bills for a couple more people too.

Anyway, today I got to cut a fun-shaped shelf into a the bathroom wall, and I'm very happy with how it's looking. I can kind of see the end in sight of this project, which is a nice feeling. Luckily, I'll have no shortage of other things to occupy my time once it's over.
