oday sure <i>looked</i> like a turning-point day. It was 73 outside in W----, and the snow has almost disappeared at my house. The time for outdoor work on the homestead is fast approaching. It's regrettable that all I want to do right now is paint tiny plastic soldiers (an admirable Winter hobby), but I know once I get into it, I won't be able to help myself from all the cool stuff I'll get up to in these woods. It's time, now that I have a wife and child on the way, to start taking a more serious stock of what needs to be done, and get a real order of priority going -- no more whims, while Summer is so short, and time with the family so fleeting. There's a lot to do, but I'm in the crank-it-out attitude right now -- we'lll get some good stuff done this Summer, baby in tow.\
