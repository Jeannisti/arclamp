<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 haven't been home in a long time. I left in the beginning of August, and have not lived under my own roof for six months now. Tomorrow, E---- and I return, finally, as husband and wife, to our own house, and begin to make it our <i>family's</i> house. I love this place so much, and I can't wait to love it even more as love takes seed within its walls. This will be the place in which my children grow up, God willing; I can't wait to see what it becomes.
