 remember being absolutely scandalized the first time I heard a musician refer to themselves <i>as themselves</i> in a song. Obviously, perhaps the majority of pop songs written employ the use of the first person, which is heavily implied much of the time to be the actual writer of the song. But this felt very different to me, as a child, from, say, the Gorillaz beginning a song with "We the Gorillaz!" A line was being crossed here; some kind of violation of the fourth wall had occurred. I had never listened to hip-hop or its derivatives growing up, and the line between "the musicians" and the "world of the song" was sacrosanct. This rule had never been explained to me, but I knew it powerfully when it was breached.

I think it's an underappreciated aspect of children the extent to which they are rule-recognizers. Children construct very powerful models of behavior based on how adults act around them, without these behaviors needing explicit delineation. Language itself is in large part the application of rules that most people never learn academically. Many of these rules end of being broken down in our adolescence, as we expand outside the household and into a larger world, but plenty of them stay.

<p>
I have a theory that this is one of the defining differences between "modern people" and "traditional people". If you can make it into your adulthood without seeing the <i>rules</i> of your childhood be self-consciously broken by outsiders, I think you end up having a very different view of the cosmos.
