uppose there were a gambling machine in which every time you pulled the lever, there was a 99% chance you would win one hundred dollars, and a 1% chance that you owe the casino $100,000. Someone pulls the lever a few times, thinking it would be nice to have $500. On the fifth pull, they get the losing result.
</p>
<p>
"I don't have $100,000!" The gambler exclaims. "This will ruin me! I can't pay it!" A mafia goon who was lurking nearby sidles up and says "Hey, if you just pay us one thousand bucks, we'll go out and squeeze some random person for the casino's money, and you'll never have to think about this again."
</p>
<p>
Is the gambler justified in taking the goon's offer?
