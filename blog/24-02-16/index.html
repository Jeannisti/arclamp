<p>
 spend a lot of time thinking about games, in a pretty rigorous and analytical way. Such mental habits are hardly the stuff of casual conversations with friends, especially when the game in question is a 4,000-year-old Chinese strategy game. But, over the past several years, my friend Ben has increasingly thrown himself into a different game, and has come to have it dominate his thoughts in the same way my own addictive diversion has. His chosen game, of course, is poker.

We had a lovely late-Valentine's-Day feast at Ben and Flea's, and most of the night Ben and I ended up talking about our various theories of games. Ben knows a <i>lot</i> more about poker than I do, but I've dipped my toes in the math and theory enough to give something for him to play off of in our conversations, and it's <i>fun</i> to try to find commonalities in our different explorations. Both of us are desperately hungry to talk about these things, and we have precious few outlets for it. A friend who can say even a <i>little</i> something about a subject you love is a glass of water in the desert, and a relief to your loved ones who have had to endure your dull monologues as well.

It was a delight. A second post in a row about how excellent my friends are? Well, they deserve more anyway. I do want to learn more about poker. That game is <i>extremely</i> fascinating. I just wish it didn't cost so much money to play...
