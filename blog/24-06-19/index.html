ust in time for me to start an LLC, hire my first employee, design a tabletop game from scratch and learn how to market it, <i>and</i> have my first child, I'm getting the itch to play TTRPGs again. I have so, so many things that I can and should be doing with my time, but now I want to break open Torchbearer and see what I can do with it.
</p>
<p>
I like the idea of the horror genre a lot, even if its true successes lie pretty thin on the ground, as far as I'm concerned. I've found that role-playing games are an interesting outlet for me to explore horror in a very cost-effective and yet emotional intimate way. My siblings know that I've cultivated something of a psychedelic horror styling in the way that I present my settings, which I'm fairly proud of. It's a funny thing to be playing in a genre with only two people as my audience.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I want to fuse my own version of modern horror with the down and dirty dungeon crawl of Torchbearer. The ideas are flowing, I just have to hope that they won't take up too much time to develop... Time is not something I'm in a commanding supply of at present.
