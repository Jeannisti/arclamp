f there happens to be enough work doing finish carpentry in this state to keep me working every day, I'd be a happy camper. I just love the process of turning of a chewed-up piece of wall into a nice, clean living space. Working by myself, taking my time, having all the right tools for the job, and getting paid reasonably well for it -- it's a great feeling. Unfortunately, I suspect these sorts of extremely pleasant jobs will be the exception rather than the rule, but I'm going to enjoy them while I can.
