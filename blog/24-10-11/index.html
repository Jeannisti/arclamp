 love routine. That's not necessarily something that I knew about myself when I was younger (say, early twenties), but I love going to bed at the same time, waking up at 6am, reading and drinking coffee for an hour, practicing guitar, doing my Go problems, and then starting to work. I love being with my wife and son, I love watching a few scary movies every week of October, I love going on walks and praying the rosary.

It's probably a good thing to like routines, because life is of necessity filled with them. If you're always looking to break them, find something new, you're going to end up spinning your wheels a lot. Routines give us traction in our lives, allow us to actually move forward. Seeking out the new can change our direction, but you can't just keep changing directions. Eventually you have to think you've found a good one, and stick with it.
