e're all a bunch of stupid children. I think this bears keeping in mind from time to time. And when I say it, I don't mean "the great mass of humanity are stupid children", or "those people are stupid children", or "<i>sometimes</i> I act like a stupid child". I mean that every single human who ever existed (with a notable exception), including me writing this and you reading this right now, is a stupid child of the Lord.

I can sometimes convince myself that the things I don't know aren't worth knowing. Or rather, that I'm probably tolerably mostly right on the important things, and that I'm tolerably understandably only sorta wrong about the things I'm wrong about. It's a sobering thought that there are incredibly important things that I <i>should</i> know, but don't; things that I absolutely <i>should</i> do, but don't. In fact, for all my preening, I'm a stupid child, blessed, like all us stupid children, by an abundantly loving God.

Whatever images you have of yourself, whatever dreams you have of what you may someday become, or whatever pedastels you've placed beneath some hero's feet; remember that to our Sovereign, they are the put-upon costumes and poses of a toddler. Possibly cute, not necessarily bad, but laughable in their pretention. We are all of us laboring under delusions, and so, so few of us have the barest inklings of our relation and obligation to Creation and its Creator. Now excuse me as I sit and sulk in the corner.
