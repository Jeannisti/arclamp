y mentality is usually one that asks itself "What should I be doing <i>more</i> of?". I rarely have the presence of mind to ask what I should be doing <i>less</i> of. Somehow, I'm always trying to convince myself that a truly enormous number of things can somehow fit into my life, without asking what needs to needs to be removed to make room for it.
</p>
<p>
Life is filled with little "blank" moments -- the time in between doing two tasks, the short minutes before something scheduled starts, the bleary-eyed sitting in the morning before the coffee kicks in, the indecisive times when we can't make up our minds about what to do. Part of me says that if I could just <i>focus in</i> and eliminate those dead times, I would have enough time to do everything I want to do. And then part of me fears greatly the killing of those times; worries that I would be turning myself into some kind of machine, ruthlessly assessing every moment for its efficiency.

I wobble back and forth between idleness and intense activity. I want to be doing things, starting things, ideally finishing things; and I want to just wander around my house and land, picking up whatever catches my interest. In my ideal world, these two would be the same thing -- I would wander aimlessly until something I wanted to do caught my attention, and I could work hard at it for as long as it pleased me, before moving on to something, or nothing, else; and the bills would still be paid. The little naive corner of my heart believes this could be a reality, but it probably can't, right?
