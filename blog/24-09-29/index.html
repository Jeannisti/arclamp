undays are often a strange day for me. I love going to Mass in the morning, and singing in the Schola; I think I feel my most "normal" when I'm at Mass, like my priorities are straight for an hour and forty-five minutes. But Sundays tend to be either filled to the brim with seeing friends and family, or else weirdly empty, unfilled with the work and tasks of the rest of the week. I'm either scrambling all over the place, or a bit listless.
</p>

I know I should spend more time in prayer on Sundays, and to an extent I often do -- but the amount of "leftover time" is still a lot, and I haven't gotten into a habit of how best to use it. I feel like a "better person" when I'm busy. When I'm not doing anything, my baser instincts tend to take over. It's a lot easier to avoid scrolling on twitter when I have a list of things to accomplish by the end of the day. It's harder to fight it off on the Day of Rest.

The question always arises -- what is work? Most of my favorite hobbies look a lot like work, or have parts of their unfolding that are <i>definitely</i> work. I'm someone who enjoys effort. But every seven days I ned to put effort aside, and try not to cheat. I need to find a way for no-effort to do good work in me. It's God's day, after all.
