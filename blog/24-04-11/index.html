<p>
 got a lot done today and came home to a wife who loves me, and a dog who loves me, and a cat who can now tolerate my presence. Things are awfully good. It was so hot out that I worked most of the day with my shirt off, getting close to closing out a project I've spent the better part of a month on. I finally brought my table saw in, and good Lord, what a difference having that thing around makes. Having the right tool for the job really ties the whole room together, as it were.

Things are busy, but they're good. I get a lot of thinking done in the car, but not a lot of it seems to end up on this blog, which is fine. I should probably spend a little more time thinking about what I'm going to write about, instead of double- and triple- and quadruple-checking whether Blackletter's rules are sufficiently well defined in my head. But we have the brain we've got, I suppose. We're not even a third of the way through the year, and it's already getting harder to find things to write about. I should experiment a little more with this space, if I can -- but I guess it's my blog, and I can write vapid nonsense if I so please. Tonight, I so please.
