'm pretty strongly considering discontinuing this daily blog project after the New Year. I'll be glad that I did it for a full year, but I'm not sure the effort is, at the end of it all, worth the reward. I want to write more; I want to improve at the craft, and use it to think more deeply about things worth thinking and writing about. But coming up with something to write about in a rush while getting ready for bed, often exhausted, and without particular interest; it's just not doing a whole lot for me, and it's an energy sink. Also, I only have like two and a half readers.

The problem will be, fundamentally -- how do I write differently? At least the commitment of daily writing is concrete and motivating. It will be interesting to see whether I can figure out a system for writing weekly or monthly posts, of more substantial character.
