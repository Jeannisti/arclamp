ho's the holiest person you know? It would be hard for me to say. Sometimes, I get a little discouraged at not having good personal role models of what it looks like to be following in God's footsteps. Radical holiness is hard to find.

<p>
This past Sunday, though, as I looked down on the pews from the choir loft and saw the community I've grown so fond of over the past years, I thought about what <i>ordinary</i> holiness looks like. I'm not sure there are any living saints in my little church, but I do think that just about every person in there has been changed at least a little bit by the presence of God in their lives. I could almost see the secular versions of a lot of these folks, and felt that each of them was a little better than they would be if they spent their Sundays unwinding at home.
</p>
<p>
It's never good to settle for spiritual mediocrity, and I'd like to find true peace in my heart, and to be able to see it in someone else. But it's a good reminder that devastatingly pure saintliness is not the only way that God works in our lives, and we should always be attentive to the small victories.
