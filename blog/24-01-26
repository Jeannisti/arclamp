e perfect, as your Father in Heaven is perfect.
</p>
<p>
St. Thomas Aquinas compares God to the sun; whose nature it is to poor abundant goodness upon all, without regard to "worthiness". The rain falls upon the rich and the poor. In this, we are called to be like the Lord. In fact, the metaphor that the Christ uses calls us to be candles that shine to the whole house, a fitting diminutive image of the sun of God.
</p>
<p>
Being humans, and not Principles of Creation itself, what our outpourings of love look like is perhaps not quite the same as the completely pure omnipresent love of the Father. We have obligations to our children, for example, that rise above our obligations to people halfway across the world, and it is not the vocation of most people to scatter their wealth as evenly as possible amongst mankind (though it certainly <i>is</i> the vocation of some who would be perfect).
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, we are called to love, and to give, in some measure above and beyond the dictates of familial and societal obligations. If we are not blessing our enemies, and giving to the undeserving in <i>some significant measure</i>, it is difficult to see in what way we are followers of Jesus.
</p>
<p>
This is hard. I struggle with it every day -- the temptation to direct my light solely on the "deserving", on my friends, and on my family. To grip tightly to what I have, out of fear and small-heartedness. I want to be holier. I want to trust more in God. I want to be able to give in good measure (what a wonderful turn of phrase -- "good measure"), first to those who depend upon me, and then, with no twisting of the will, to the poor, the needy, the naked, the prisoners, the wicked, and those who need the blessing of He who is Goodness itself. I don't know how to get there -- please, pray for me.
