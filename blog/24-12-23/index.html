<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 like to make and hold little objects in my hands. I started turning trash into little buildings in the past couple years, and I'm thinking about turning to sculpture more generally. It's a shame that most of my artistic output has been in forms that aren't really "there" -- it's all sketchbooks and digital art, nothing you can hold in your hands, and feel its substance. I want to try dicking around with whittling, carving, and sculpting clay, and seeing where that takes me. Ideally, I can start to sculpt my house as well, and I can start to live within my own world of creation. The hands; the eyes!
