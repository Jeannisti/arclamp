ery busy. I should take this as an Advent penance (since Lord knows I'm not fasting...). Every day has been filled right to the brim for the last three days, and the next five don't look much roomier. I'm very excited for Christmas to roll around; for every accumulated mote of exhaustion and stress, I should lay down a thought of anticipation for the coming of the little Lord. Really make that relief at the opening up of the salvation story hit as hard as it can.
