<p>
here are a lot of things I'm not going to be able to do in my life. I'll never be as good an artist as Alan Lee, and I'll never leave stone monuments that can be found hundreds of years in the future. I won't be a 9-dan Go player, or a great martial artist, or a literary savant. I've been dealt a certain hand, and I've played it a certain way up to now -- and there are fewer ways now to keep playing it than there used to be. That's how it goes.
