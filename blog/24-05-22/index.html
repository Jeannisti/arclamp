othing means Summer like driving a car on your lawn. There's something so outlandish about the sight that overflows the normal course of things, and is only possible when the air is full of the energy of the season (even if it isn't truly Summer yet, Summer rolls in behind the car like exhaust). When I was a child, I remember that seeing my parents driving on the lawn felt like it was <i>business time</i>. It still feels that way, when extraordinary means are called for, and the road can no longer contain your ambition.
