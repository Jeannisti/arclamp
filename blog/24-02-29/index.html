<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
 dropped off my car to get a trailer hitch attached to it today, and then I walked to a nearby cafe. Yesterday, the thermometer sat, taking it easy, at 60 degrees. This morning, it was 15, with 30 mph winds, and I was walking directly into them. I drained my coffee, stuffed the mug into a side pocket of my backpack, and set my face directly into the torrent of cold.
</p>
<p>
It often happens with pain, that when you look at it directly, you have to admit that it doesn't hurt <i>all that much</i> -- but it is attended by an overwhelming desire to get rid of it at any costs. It's a particularly potent kind of discomfort, which takes an iron will to resist. The pain trudging into the icy blast was something like that. When I drilled down into my perceptions, no one part of it was excruciating -- not the headache, not the burning ears, not the chapped lips. But taken as a whole, with the backburner of my mind screaming at me to get out of the cold, the experience was abysmal. It wasn't that bad; but it sucked. I remember looking around at every street corner, desperately trying to assess where the unfamiliar cafe was, strung taut with the idea that I might soon be in a heated building.
</p>
<p>
Then I read a math textbook over coffee for three hours or so until the hitch was installed, and I walked back to the U-Haul. It had turned into something of a nice day on the way back, and the wind had stopped blowing -- and I simply couldn't believe how short the walk was. It must have been literally five minutes; but in my struggle that morning, I'd have sworn it was almost twenty. The intense firing of every nerve just overloaded my circuits, and I genuinely lost sense of time. I'd barely had time to squeeze in a thought on the second trip before I was there. Remarkable how malleable time is, and when it choosing to get all bent out of shape.
