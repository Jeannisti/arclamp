've been accused of not liking games that I'm not the best at. This is slightly unfair, but kind of true? I will say, as counterexample, that I'm by no means the greatest poker player ever, or even amongst my friends and family; I doubt that I take down more tables, really, than anyone else. But, I absolutely adore the game, and look for opportunities to play it, even if it means losing money regularly.
</p>
<p>
What really makes me look like a selective game player, I think, is really that my <i>winning</i> can upgrade a game that I don't particularly care for into a pretty good experience, but losing throws into sharp relief that I just don't like the act of playing this particular very much.
</p>
<p>
And that's what it should come down to. How does the game feel <i>before</i> winning or losing? Obviously, everybody likes winning, but a game isn't good because I'm winning. A game is good when the act of playing it is exciting, and comprehensible, but still a little deep and strategic. I promise, I don't <i>need</i> to win to like a game! But I tend to be kind of good at the games I like.

Playing poker with my siblings is so, so fun. It's particularly great that any one of us could take down a night of playing, there's no foregone conclusion that one of us will win over and over (though W---- probably wins the most). Poker is one of those lovely games that rewards both hard work, study, and shrewd play, and also rewards madmen throwing their lives into the winds of chance. It feels like anything could happen; but you can still get <i>better</i>. Like you're cheating Chance itself.
