oday, four people were simultaneously playing two games of Blackletter, and I wasn't even one of them. The game might actually be taking on a life of its own, and the playtest in town was extremely fun, even if the majority of the people there were just my friends.

<p>
My area was absolutely blasted with rain again on the way home, and flash flooding overtook a lot of the major roads. I had to test my geography knowledge to dodge around closed roads, but it finally let out right at the finish line, a mile and a half from my house, where water was streaming across the street. After assessing it for a while, I parked my car, took off my shoes, and waded up to my knees across the overflow, and walked the rest of the way home. My road is a lot more unsettling in the pitch darkness, with the sound of angry water flowing around, and the constant threat of rain. It's good to have an adventure every now and then.
