'm learning a lot about business right now. I've started my own company, and, it turns out, it's a lot of work. I'm not making much money right now, but I'm making enough to get buy, and the educational experience is pretty wild. I like doing my own work, and I like setting my own schedule. It helps that I know how to work hard, and that I don't have a lot of temptation for things like video games or TV.

There are a lot of people out there who work their asses off for $50,000 a year. I really don't want to be doing that, long term. There are some people who work their asses off and make $500,000 a year. I really, really, want to find some way to make $50,000 without having to put in all that many hours. It seems like it should be possible, considering just how productive some people can make their time. How do you make yourself valuable, without getting sucked into 60 hour work weeks?
