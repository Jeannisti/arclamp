hat does it mean to be wise? How are we converted from ignorance into wisdom? How, in seeking wisdom, do we not fall into pride? Who is the master of the wise man?

I want my heart to be able to change. I want to be able to look on life with equanimity, to see things as they really are, and to be unafflicted by earthly sorrows. I know the formula -- place God before all things -- but I do not know the practice. Maybe I'm not supposed to know it yet, and maybe I'll never know it. Probably the vision I have of what it means to be a saint or a sage is wildly off base.

I had a thought once, to go to the holiest person I know, and ask them who the holist person they know is. Then, I would go to that person, and ask them who the holiest person they know is, and so on and so forth, seeking out, somewhere, a living saint who I might meet.
