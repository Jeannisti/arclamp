e ate outside today, in the cool, sunny air; I haven't had an old-fashioned picnic in a very long time. Tuna fish on home-made bread, and a dog as a pillow. I started work on a chicken coop, and saw one deer, and heard another late at night. Reconnected with a friend who's been in Mexico the last two months, and ran an excellent Blackletter playtest. Had a meeting our midwife, and bought Cap'n Crunch -- buy one get one free. The entire atmosphere of life is charged with potential, as the turning of the ninth month approaches. If I ever feel nostalgic for these days, let it be said that the feeling will be deserved.
