omorrow is America's day of Thanksgiving. I'm looking forward to it tremendously, even if it threatens to be a fairly awkward family arrangement. I want to become a good host -- I want to practice being generous with guests, with making people feel at ease, with making our home an "outer center" of socializing and culture. Unfortunately, such things require some regular infusions of cash, but that's what budgeting is for -- you determine what things are most important to you, and you figure out how to pay for them.

Wouldn't it be nice to read poetry at events like this? I should find a way to start introducing the custom. It can come off as kind of cringey, but it used to be commonplace. As with so many things, taste and confidence are what give it any chance of being sold.
