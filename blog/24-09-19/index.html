<p>
 started a compost pile recently, and now I can't stop thinking about it. When compost was just a place to put certain foods, I couldn't get into it. "Oh, now I have to walk outside to get rid of something? And maybe in 5 years I'll have dirt instead of gross pile of scraps that I can't keep my dog out of?" It wasn't very exciting. Then I found out I could take grass clippings and make a 150 degree compost <i>oven</i> that would rapidly convert into fertilizer, and well -- t's indicative of my personality that once I found out I could take something that I thought of as <i>useless</i> and turn it, at scale, into something useful -- I mean, I'm a hardworking cheapskate; lemme at that. Every morning, I can't wait to get up, turn my compost pile over, keep it moist, and see what temperature it's gotten up to, rake up some more green matter. It smells so earthy and pungent, it's a great way to wake up in the morning.

So many things become enjoyable once you make a certain mental switch. I'm hoping growing food out of the ground next year becomes one of them.
