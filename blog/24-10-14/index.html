t's late and I have to write something quickly, cuz I need to get to bed. I'm continually having thoughts about what to write my blog post about during the day, but I never seem to be near a computer, or notebook, or tape recorder when the ideas strike. It's been hard to come up with things recently. I've been writing this blog now daily for more than 3/4 of a year, which is not bad, but is definitely catching up with me. I don't mind that the process is a little bit rote -- I'd like to be experimenting more with style and content, and trying harder to find my "voice", which I don't think I have yet -- but just doing <i>any</i> writing every day is still good for me. I could try to prioritize "figuring out" my writing more, but I haven't yet; and I can't blame myself for not improving in something that I haven't actually decided to set my mind to. I'll just have to make a decision, whether to keep this writing on its current, casual keel; or deciding to do something more with it. But I'm not making the decision yet.

I did, however, make the decision to practice guitar and Go more regularly -- those have times set aside every morning, and they're (slowly) bearing fruit. But I'm out of the 1800s doldrums on my Go server -- for months I was stuck at a rank far lower than what I would call my natural rank, but I just couldn't break out. Well, I finally did it, and I'm back in the mid-1900s. That feels good, but I'm trying not to make too big a thing of the feeling, or I'll feel terrible when I start to slip again. Still -- 2000, here I come. Watch out.
