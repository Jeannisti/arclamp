y life is very full these days. In an earlier post, I mentioned my use of Mark Forster's "Do It Tomorrow" system, which continues to bear great fruit in my life. However, one of the main things that it revealed to me is that I am a profligate spender of time. I was a debtor who did not know how much debt he was in, and was digging his hole ever deeper.
</p>

I'm currently working on setting up my own business, but the actual "work" of carpentry that I'm doing is pretty minimal -- I doubt I'm on site more than 10 hours a week these days. However, my days are absolutely <i>packed</i> with the various things of my life that need accomplishing, and it's a marvel that I managed to get anything done back when I was working 40 hours a week. I'm getting a great deal done, and feeling far more organized and hopeful about my workload in general; but I have now felt what "one day's work in Jack's life" feels like, and it's a <i>lot</i> more than I was putting in before.
</p>
<p>
The principle that I'm trying to take to heart is "slow and steady". No frantic racing to a task's end, no switching projects halfway through; just small amounts of work, over and over, on specifically chosen things until they're done. Honestly, just realizing the extent to which you can break projects into smaller pieces, and do them five or ten minutes at a time, is a game-changer. I just feel now like I'm not lying to myself when I say "I'll get around to it."
