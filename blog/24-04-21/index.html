 got to introduce two friends to Blackletter today. It's always funny explaining the Warhammer universe to newbies; it's so outrageous and gonzo, and I can just rattle off the basics of it like it's nothing -- I very much enjoy being able to convey enthusiasm for these sorts of things, especially to people who aren't prototypical nerds. There's a method of presentation that can just make something seem unexpectedly cool and interesting, if you're used to talking to normal people about stuff. Enthusiasm is contagious.

What's more, and better, I get to introduce them to the great setting of Warhammer 40k without having to couch it in the bad game of Warhammer 40k. Blackletter went over very well -- Michael was impressed, if perhaps a little overwhelmed, but Tyler, the younger of the two, caught on instantly. He was formulating novel strategies by his second game, and immediately grasped how he wanted to build his army; he's now planning out what faction he wants to play, and I suspect he might jump in with both feet. He's a hobby-centric, smart, creative guy, and this particularly hobby can absorb a lot of energy.

I just enjoy playing this freakin game, and I love being able to expand the circle of people I can bug about it. Ideally, I'll get enough <s>victims</s> friends engaged with it, that I only have to bother each of them every month or two, and I'll still get to play once a week. A game designer can dream...
