e watched The Godfather tonight, for Elena's first time and my...fourth time, perhaps? I have an interesting relationship with this movie. When I was young, my family repeatedly watched Steve Odekirk's Thumb Movies -- a ridiculous series of spoofs of famous films, such as Thumb Wars, Frankenthumb, and of course, The Godthumb. Because of this spoof, I was actually very familiar with a great number of the most famous scenes from The Godfather, which actually kind of ruined the film for me for a while. I remember the first time that I saw the movie, I could tell that it was "great", but it almost seemed <i>too</i> iconic. The scenes had been built up so much, both by silly spoofs, and simply existing in American culture, that I couldn't really lace them together into a coherent movie. It was just a bunch of iconic scenes in a row.

Basically every time I watched the film, this feeling has lessened, and this particular viewing felt <i>very</i> fresh. It definitely helped having a first-time viewer along for the ride, but I was just astonished at how quickly the three hour movie passed. It was just intoxicating the whole way through, and I felt like the plot really grabbed me this time.

I used to say that The Godfather Part II was what made the Godfather Part I make sense to me, and while this is still sort of true, I feel much more holistically assured in my enjoyment of Part I by itself. I'm obsessed with the very first line in The Godfather, uttered by the undertaker: "I believe in America." These two films are about what believing in America does to a person, and to a people; and about the difference between the old world and the new.
