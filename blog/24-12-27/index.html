e drove to Maine today, through Eastern Vermont and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. This was one of those times that I realized the extent to which I take my homeland for granted; the Guatemalan girls were obsessed with the Wintertime magic that flowed down from the peaks to the valleys that we cruised through. Every view was the sort of picturesque vista you think only exist in painter's minds, but they were all there, cute and quaint and breathtaking at the same time. It's always nice to bring someone along who can make you see things anew.
