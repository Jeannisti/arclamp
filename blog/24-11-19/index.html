 need to, maybe every month or so, watch a movie with some big, strong men in it. It's excellent motivation. I'm blessed enough to still be relatively young (at least as far as beginning a weightlifting regime goes), and seeing flicks like Predator just makes me want to go out there and get strong.

Problem is, momentary inspiration is worth just about nothing. Time and consistency are the real winners, and shots in the arm of movie bulky boys is not going to cut it forever. Like with speaking Spanish in our home, you just have to keep reminding yourself to stick with it, and keep getting back on that horse.
