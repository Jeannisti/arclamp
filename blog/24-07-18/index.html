<p>
've had a few days off work since my last job finished up, before my next one hits the road. I've been trying to get into the habit of making myself a little to-do list in the morning, and then cranking those suckers out. I always have a couple of things running little anxiety algorithms in the back of my mind, and the little devils tell me that even sitting down to <i>do</i> those things will make me even more anxious. "They're too big, too complicated, you'll just stress yourself out trying, so just ignore them, and they'll go away."
</p>
<p>
But, of course, nothing's really too bad, and if it is, you just have to break it into smaller pieces until it feels manageable. I do love the feeling of working my way down a good list of tasks -- the trick is making sure the list is <i>actually</i> good, that you're getting to the important things, while simultaneously not overwhelming yourself.
</p>
<p>
I seem to respond well to lists, which is something I should remember about myself. I think it might have something to do with my bad memory. The general anxiety of forgetting something important eats away at me a lot; and my problems can seem a lot bigger when I can't "see them all at once". Then I write down as complete a list as I can of what I'm trying to do, and it puts it in perspective. I brainstorm in a similar way -- just write, write, write, whatever I can think of related to whatever I need to solve, and it's amazing the progress that can happen.
