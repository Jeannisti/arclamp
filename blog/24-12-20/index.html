<p class="bigCap">I</p>

<p>
'm approaching weighing 200 lbs for the first time in my life (my "natural" weight has been a solid 175 for many years). I started a new workout program about a month ago; I've done this before, but this time I've rigorously kept to my schedule so far, <i>and</i>, more importantly, I've been eating a <i>ton</i>. Way more than I'm used to, and frankly way more than is comfortable most of the time. But boy does the math check out -- if you eat more calories than you use in a day, turns out you gain weight.

This program starts out somewhat easy, and then starts to get hard right about where I am. I think the next two weeks are going to be a bit of a test, both mentally and physically for me. I'm definitely stronger than I was when I started, but I'm only 25%-33% of the way through this 3-4 month program. It's going to start getting crazy. I hope I don't hurt myself.
