<p>
'm making tiny houses out of cardboard and garbage again. Elena and I are putting together a little miniature town for our Nativity Cr√®che, and I'm planning to make my pieces able to double as terrain buildings for Blackletter (obviously). After John was born I took many months off of scratch-building, and now that the weather's turning colder, I'm getting back into it. I had forgotten what a relaxing, pleasurable time it is. Seeing two-dimensional pieces of trash firm up, stack and layer, become solid, take form, and suddenly become delightful little pieces of art is magical. I don't notice the time passing at all, and I think I'm figuring out how to fit it into my schedule without too much disruption. It feels good to be at it again, and I'm excited to see how the pieces turn out. The best moment is always the spray-painting -- when all the disparate, distracting colors disappear, and the object becomes <i>solid</i> in its monotone. I can't wait.
